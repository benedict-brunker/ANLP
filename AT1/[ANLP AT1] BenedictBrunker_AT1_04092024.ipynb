As a form of language use, Talkback Radio (TR) occupies an intermediate position between purely spontaneous conversation on the one hand, and formal public address on the other: \"while talkback radio is addressed at a public audience it is frequently unplanned, improvised or 'ad hoc' and participants must communicate in real-time\" (Bednarek: 2014, 4-5).\n","\n","<h3>Opportunities</h3>\n","\n","The semi-spontaneous character of this form of language therefore offers an interesting opportunity to study vernacular patterns of language use. TR conversations are predominantly spoken in the local vernacular, offering an opportunity to analyze locally distinct patterns of usage. At the same time, TR must be comprehensible to a broad population of listeners at a regional, and in some cases national, level. It therefore doesn't present the same challenges as truly spontaneous natural language use in everyday speech, which can be prohibitively idiolectic or hyper-localized.\n","<br><br>\n","TR corpora also represent a range of dialogic speech situations, recording:\n","\n","1. Dialogue between hosts and callers.\n","2. Dialogue between hosts and guests.\n","3. Dialogue between co-hosts.\n","4. <i>Pseudo-dialogue</i> between the singular host and the passive listening audience.\n","\n","This dialogic diversity affords opportunities for analyzing varying patterns of usage depending on conversational contexts.\n","\n","<h3>Analysis: Data and Scope</h3>\n","\n","This preliminary textual analysis will consider 29 TR transcripts of Australian radio talk: 14 recordings from public broadcaster ABC National Radio (NAT),  broadcasts to eastern Australian (ABCE) and to southern and western Australia (ABCNE); as well as 15 recordings from commercial broadcasts to eastern Australia (COME) and southern and western Australia (COMNE).\n","<br>\n","Our analysis focusses primarily on frequently occurring terms and collocations, drawing on the work of previous scholars like Bednarek (2014), who analyzed 'markers of linguistic involvement' in Australian Talkback Radio (ART). In general, we take a 'corpus-wide' approach, examining patterns of usage that are common across regions, and across the public-commercial divide. We employ a quantitative empirical analysis to identify features of interest, alongside a more qualitative analysis of phrases' semantic meanings and pragmatic functions. As this brief introduction hopefully makes clear, our analysis is far from exhaustive: much more remains to be learned and analyzed from these data.\n","\n","<h3>Challenges</h3>\n","\n","TR text transcripts are frequently raw and messy, for instance preserving misfluencies like 'uh', 'um' and 'oh', which presents preprocessing challenges. Transcripts are generally highly unstructured, with little built-in annotation of features. The ART corpus we use here is characteristic in these respects.\n","<br><br>\n","Our analysis therefore gives some attention to the methodological questions involved in preprocessing RT transcript data, such as stopword curation and tokenization strategies.\n",""],"metadata":{"id":"MZnl4lNxa4v4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 1.

It it coulda been produced by the um surgery uh obviously I mean you can ha have interference with uh the blood supply to the remaining ovary under these conditions that might have uh faded away a bit earlier that it woulda done under normal conditions.\n"," Okay. Well the second issue I wanna bring up is um the issue of alternative therapy it actually does work um because I've refused to go on H R T so I've been experimenting for qu well ever since I've been forty-two . Um but I have found that of course it's only short term and it may last for three or four months and then y'know you you look at then you have to look at self medicating. And that's another worry for me is is ha I'm on three alternative therapy medications now. Uh I don't know who to turn to to say yes that's too much or no y'know you shouldn't be doing that because I I don't know if there's much research on self medication   but I find it difficult there's no registry to say that there's specialists in menopause that look at both alternative therapies and H R T. But um y'know I don't have that choice and uh I find it difficult how do I ascertain what is what is the a a good level to to maintain alther alternative therapy.\n"," Well uh there are two parts to it uh that you've explained uh and we've done a lot of work a lotta people have done some research on alternative therapies by the way um. The big thing is that we look at what is natural the previous uh caller um Lynne I think it was talked about natural oestrogen um possibly implying that the pharmaceutical companies don't use natural oestrogen well they do but um you produce from your ovary something called seventeen beta oestradiol . Which is very rapidly uh metabolised to uh something called oestrone which is much weaker than oestradiol  and then eventually it's metaboli that again is metabolised within probably two or three hours to oestriol which is the excretory product. Now um those things are found in every woman's body throughout her normal reproductive life when she goes through the menopause um the levels fall down she stops producing oestradiol but there is still some oestrone being produced and thats being produced by conversion of other products what we call precursors sometimes from the adrenal gland sometimes from other areas into oestrone and that's uh reasonably active uh throughout most women's lives but whether it's enough for your needs depends on so many different factors. Uh for the majority of women going through the menopause it's not enough and they need some top up.\n"," Mm yeah well it certainly might be in my case uh since the hot flushes I can tolerate but it's the sleep deprivation   that uh causes the problems you you're waking up three-four times a night.\n"," You you probably need to have your levels of uh oestradiol measured  and as the if there is sufficient oestradiol there it will act on your brain and the pituitary phos uh pituitary gland to um   uh reduce the level of follicular stimulating hormone and I use the level of follicular stimulating hormone and oestradiol as an indication as to whether the patient is getting sufficient oestrogen or not. Um and if you see somebody with some expertise in the area you will probably find that they will measure those and tell you whether you have got sufficient uh oestrogen in there to stop your hot flushes.\n"," Thanks uh Edith uh Karen you you wanna talk about attitudes to this whole issue.\n"," Well yes I do I've had I'm one of the alternate people and I've had fantastic results not only through my menopausal time but with other bodily problems through changing my diet 'n' going back to foods that don't come from a factory   and I h um haven't gone onto H R T I don't like the stories I've heard about the suffering of mares in the northern hemisphere to get the necessary oestrogen for H R T. Um.\n"," Ye you're talking about Premarin there I think.\n"," Look I don't know um which specific I'm talking about it's the horse stories that bother me so much but I also want to make two strong points it isn't menopause isn't necessarily something to be suffered and also it isn't just a hormonal and bodily change I've found incredible new wisdoms have come to me   about life through my menopausal years so it's not just a hormonal and bodily change it's far broader than that.\n"," Oh you're quite right I mean   I don't want you to feel that um uh women have to have it or have t h suh h suffer any symptoms. Uh quite a large number of women have no problems whatsoever going through the menopause either   physically or mentally or uh uh emotionally in any way at all but others are affected and we should not e or nobody should say oh because I didn't have any problems then somebody else shouldn't have any either.\n"," Mm Karen thank you very much for your thoughts uh Ruth um you you want a word about relationship between migraines and the menopause.\n"," Yes thank you Tony. Um I've been suffering migraines for about twenty years I get about two a month always around the same time   and my doctor keeps telling me that when I go through menopause they'll go away. Um I'm forty-nine I'm just premenopausal I suppose although I'm still getting regular periods. I'm just wondering if I go onto H R T if I need to. What's gunna happen with my migraines.\n"," Oh that's a very good question and uh thank you for asking it. The big thing to remember is that both men and women get migraines so it's  not just uh to do with hormones . However if hormones are a cause for uh migraine headaches it's usually because there is some triggering either a high level or a low level suddenly occurring . So women who are menstruating   normally of course the levels of hormones go up and down they  fluctuate  throughout the month and it's that fluctuation or rise and fall that so often triggers the migraine  headache . When you go through the menopause if your hormo if your migraines are produced by hormones taking a continual daily dosage should relieve that  particular problem. Or if the levels go right down and you've got no hormones at all present and there's no f triggering their either  they will probably disappear.\n"," So w w perhaps then it would it even be it may prove helpful to go onto H R T just to for the migraines.\n"," Oh it it is I mean I have a lot of patients who are in their twenties and thirties that I have treated and relieved I hah I don't cure anything but I relieve their menopausal symptoms and triggers by giving them uh various types of hormonal therapies which will give them no uh uh triggering uh f rise or fall.\n"," Okay.\n"," Alright Ruth thanks for the call uh we don't have time for another one uh we did have a a caller ring in saying can trauma bring on an early menopause.\n"," Uh depends on the trauma if it's a trauma to the pelvis such as involving the uh ovaries or to the pituitary gland uh it may bring on a premature menopause but   uh trauma to the legs or the arm is unlikely to do something like that.\n"," The book is called Understanding Menopause and Hormonal Therapy A woman's guide Dr Barry Wren is the author and uh it's out and about now through McGraw Hill. Uh Barry thanks very much for joining us tonight. Appreciate it.\n"," Very great pleasure.\n"," Good to see you.

The question was what strap holds a pack saddle onto a horse  and the  said surcingle and you agreed and I'd bet big money it's a girth.\n"," Yeah well look I I I genuinely Ron I c I couldn't argue with you I mean if you if you say it's a girth it uh it possibly is but I I um.\n"," Surcingle a surcingle is the outer strap and it's more or less a safety strap in case the girth gives.\n"," Yeah I I'm noh look. I'm not an expert in that area I I d I don't know horses uh at all so um  y'know I I'll bow to your experience I I'm just I I I I can only go on what sh what uh madam lash gives me  and sh that's what she had and um so if it uh I don't think we   uh did anybody any damage through it though but um if we did sorry.

Because she fears trains could be a terrorist target. I guess what shocked me was that someone who I've always considered being intelligent and of sound judgement is now scared to perform a simple everyday task like commuting to work. Tt makes you wonder to what extent we're all frightened and that we might be at the centre of the next terrorist attack. Obviously the latest bombings in Madrid have focused us on the on the potential   for such a horrific thing to occur in our own back yard   and news reports say that uh a video tape received by the Spanish government claimed that the Al Qaeda terrorist network was responsible for the bombings which last week killed two hundred and injured many many more. The attack was reportedly a payback for Spain's cooperation with the United States over Iraq. So where does that leave us so I guess even the Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Kelty uh appears to have contradicted a key government message by claiming   Australia's decision to commit troops to Iraq has possibly increased the risk of Australia becoming a terrorist target. Now that does make me feel a little nervous but prime minister Howard is sticking to the key message saying there's no direct link between the Madrid bombings and Australia. He says all western countries are in fact potential terrorist targets. Australia is now in the process of analysing its own antiterrorist laws but can any amount of police protection guarantee the safety of a nation's citizen. I think not uh even Mr Howard acknowledges   that life must go on and that governments are limited in what they can do. He says the idea that you can guard every movement of every person on every railway station in every part of Australia is lunatic. It's unrealistic. So w   how safe do you feel. I mean is your life affected by the threat of terrorism. It's our issue tonight the threat of terrorism here on our shores like to have your thoughts.\n","\n","\n"," The next issue is how far do we go to try and ensure our safety. Should our authorities be given broader powers. Something that New South Wales is certainly having a look at uh the Herald is reporting tomorrow   that uh the security laws that have been put in place already will be reviewed to see if they need to be toughened. Because uh   the meeting that took place in Sydney indicated that um Sydney could be a major target. Tt following the attacks in Madrid prime minister Howard ordered a national meeting of transport security chiefs. That was uh that's coincided with the start of this five day annual security conference in Sydney in which the police chiefs from all the states 'n' t all the territories along with uh some of their counterparts from Asia will look at how Australia and its near neighbours can actually better counter this terrorism threat. New South Wales premier Bob Carr delivered the keynote speech and presented his five point plan on counterterrorism. It includes uh a major review of all New South Wales offences which could be linked to a terrorist act or threat   sharing information between state and federal governments and agencies   and the concept of setting up a ministry for homeland security. I guess similar to the American model. Er the federal opposition leader Mark Latham is also calling for a one stop shop. Saying what's needed here is an integrated coordinated approach to protect commuter transport networks. Police and security experts are also pushing for an overhaul of of Commonwealth counterterrorism laws which they claim harm their ability to find and charge terrorists. New South Wales police commissioner Ken Moroney is saying that the primary police   concerns uh are lifting restrictions on how long terror suspects could be detained. And being permitted to use material gathered with listening devices as evidence in court. Currently most listening device warrants issued for terror investigation can only be issued for intelligence gathering purposes   not in courts. Also on the commissioner's agenda are moves for police to take greater control of the area around scenes of terror attacks and to use security guards as a as a quasi counterterrorist spy network. Now this follows the news that the federal government plans to introduce a new offense of consorting with terrorists. The laws would be loosely based on some state laws which jail people who associate with criminals.\n","\n","\n"," Tt civil libertarians have slammed the proposal they're warning innocent people are gunna get dragged into police investigations which will interfere with freedom of association. Do you have any concerns   how far should we go in our efforts to protect our country our citizens our transport systems. Our issue tonight is about the threat of terrorism here in Australia. Like to hear your comments. Some interesting uh material in in uh what the papers were saying. Uh they're suggesting that the F B I has clearly stated that Australia is a terror target. I know it's not something the prime minister wants to hear but uh the F B I is saying yes it is   Sydney could be one city um but it could be Canberra it could be Melbourne. I suppose um the instant reaction to the Spanish   bombings where we saw a government thrown out over the weekend because of its poor response to terrorism   has sent a an extra chill through some western governments. You uh saw the conservative government that had been closely associated with   George W Bush uh a strong supporter of Tony Blair um basically chucked out of office. And uh the socialist government that has come in in Spain is saying we are pulling our troops out of Iraq by June if there isn't a U N mandate in place if there's not U N   control of what's happening in Iraq. So um y'know as much as we say y'know the the thing that we want to avoid is having the terrorist attacks influence us uh I suh I suppose in Spain it's had a very direct influence a change of government.\n","\n","\n"," G'day Robin.\n"," Oh.\n"," You're saying that uh multiculturalism uh as far as you're concerned is actually hindering the the efforts to uh to deal with terrorism.\n"," Oh I think so I I think that uh we were uh I I only say that twenty-five years ago I thought it was one of the most foolish policies we embarked on without   a procker proper consultation with the Australian people. That one of the upshots of it is the fact that if you've got four-hundred-thousand Muslims in Australia which we now have according to the Australian   um it makes the the job diabolically difficult uh because the nature of terrorism is it hides amongst   people uh causes great difficulties and great rifts within the population and really that's what I had to say that uh we were going to be a terrorist target anyway.\n"," Yeah but I mean we don't wanna start uh y'know uh just painting Muslims as as as as a a an enemy from within I mean there're there're plenty of uh Muslims who detest terrorism to the back teeth   and yes there are some extremists in the in the community both worldwide and here   but uh y'know they're very much in the minority.\n"," Yes but that's exactly what I'm saying. I'm not saying that the majority of Muslims are terrorists or even even uh identify with terrorism what I'm saying is that the fight against terrorism since its Islamic terrorism is just made ih virtually impossible now with the very large number of Muslims in Australia it's not possible to identify who's a terrorist and who's not because it's so difficult to get an entree w into a community which is in fact quite separate from mainstream Australia . I'm just saying it's much much more difficult.\n"," Okay well well ih ih how are we gunna deal with that if that's uh if that is the case and it's something we obviously can't reverse.\n"," You can't deal with it. That's what I said twenty-five years ago. The policy of multiculturalism is irreversible. If you make a mistake you can't undo   twenty-five years of immigration. Um you just can't do it . I was talking to Jewish friend the other day and I said how's all this affecting you and he said look   we have prayers  at um at the synagogue where you always kept the door open. Now we have to notify the rabbi um h whether we're coming or not because they close the door and they have to know how many people are in there. Uh I mean this is affecting the whole of our life and uh.\n"," It is very disturbing I I I understand that and um I don't know whether we'll ever feel as secure as we have in the past. I think I think the the future is going to be more difficult to deal with.\n"," Oh well we've got to be very tough there's no doubt about that.\n"," Mm well we we we're in a situation also where there seems to be a new strand of terrorism with these explosions in Madrid. Uh there was no suicide bombers involved with this this was uh just y'know gear that was placed in y'know prominent positions on public transport and exploded.\n"," Yes it's like the AIDS virus it can replicate itself in whole range of variables and as you say we're never going to get rid of it but if we are tough and we elect the right leaders and we have a f firm determination to be fair to everyone but also to be very tough with our own freedoms and we're gunna have to make those sacrifices   we can certainly beat it in the end but it's going to be a m a m as you say a very massive job.\n"," Thanks very much Robin Wayne you you're saying uh does John Howard think the earth is flat as well.\n"," Yeah well after uh his comments on radio tonight and on um seven-thirty report wuh I think he must.\n"," Mm.\n"," It's unbelievable wuh anyway uh you started off your commentary abou um do you feel um uh scared or anything like that and would you   um wuh I I don't particularly feel scared where I am and I guess you know where I am.\n"," Mm.\n"," Um but um.\n"," Well it's close to the national capital.\n"," Yes that's right but um I think I'd be um a bit worried if I was travelling around Sydney on um public public transport 'n' stuff  .Um.\n"," I think I think  I think the scary thought is that y'know it doesn't require the uh the suicide bombers that uh September eleven required  uh y'know these've essentially y'know they they've just got technology that allows them to uh y'know detonate these things remotely.\n"," That's right yeah um by like you can do 'em with your phone y'know your   mobile phone or anything or it be ve um which  makes it very scary . But um yes.\n"," I mean is there any answer to it I mean ih can you defend yourself against something.\n"," I don't think so no I um you can beef up beef up all the uh security as as much as you like and I don't think you'll be able to stop it.\n"," Mm.\n"," Yeah so but anyway I'll leave  with that.\n"," Thanks very much  uh Sue you you believe there is a greater threat.\n"," Well I think there is look I've lived in the U K for two and a half years Tony   and uh at one stage there was a bomb that went off in London Bridge. And luckily I didn't know about it at the time my ex husband was going up towards London Bridge and his train got diverted off sideways. But I figure that your time is up whenever your time is up and now it doesn't matter which government has been in power in the U K the I R A's been operating there for ever s ever so long and they can't s uh stop it's only  in the last few years but the other thing is Howard's in a bit of a bind. If we n not that before we went in to Iraq and Afghanistan there wasn't any of these special security increase legislation   for t antiterrorism and things like that. It's only since and we've all all of a sudden   these big t antiterrorist conferences it's since going into Iraq so one can only conclude   that it is because of going in and p being a part of the coalition of the willing and the other thing   is that at least now Howard his credibility has been peeled back a bit as Glen Milne said in The Australian. Peeled back a bit and you can't just rely on oh national security national security because   he's not he's n b he's there is no way that he can protect every everyone it's gunna happen it's gunn happen and  and I think  equal.\n"," I'd better leave it there Sue I we're about to hit the news but more comments after the news this is the NightLife.\n","\n","\n"," Yeah it's uh very disturbing indeed there are a lot of issues to deal with uh ih this question and uh it all seems to   um surround the uh police powers. Uh the the the future of um exactly how we try and deal with terrorism in Australia   and exactly what sort of changes we need to make to our lifestyle and to ensure that uh everything's gunna be okay or is it possible to ch make those sort of changes perhaps we're gunna be uh caught no matter what happens. Jill uh y you believe we need to stand firm in this whole thing.\n"," Y yeah yeah same Tony um I think y'know Australia ih is y'know sort of joined the rest of the world in in uh   in the wake of these terrorist threats I mean I I think our era of splendid isolation is well and truly over. Um when I say stand firm I I think uh uh what I mean is we need to stand firm in being fair to people. In um oh it's an old fashioned term but in doing good I suppose  of y'know keeping faith and hope and not becoming um terrorised. I mean I must admit when I heard about the bombings in Madrid I work my workplace is opposite a railway station I thought oh that's no good . And I remember when I was in London in ninety-six and I was really shocked y'know I wasn't prepared for   um y'know no rubbish bins all the messages on the trains saying don't leave packages unattended and it really did make me feel uneasy for a while . But I.\n"," It's very necessary isn't it when you w when you see things like this happening in Madrid.\n"," Well I don't know I don't know how far you go y'know I really don't know how far you go. I still think y'know the chance of being in a being killed in a car accident is much higher isn't it.\n"," Oh absolutely. And in fact uh I th I think that's something that most officials say uh that y'know if it really changes our lives they've won. Simply because  uh y'know they y'know they've ac got the ability to to to make change and to drive change by the terrorist actions . And yes the chance of us um being killed individually as uh y'know a percentage in uh y'know o ad id ih everyday chance it's it's quite  you've probably bigger chance of being crushed by an elephant but   y'know I mean uh uh y'know the last thing we want is uh y'know a Bali bombing happening even closer to home.\n"," Yeah and I think our uh our part in the w what are we called the coalition of something or other .\n"," Coalition of the willing.\n"," The willing  that's right. I think that has made us um more of a target. And I think the Spanish government was thrown out because of that but also because they lied about it y'know they tried to blame ETA immediately. Trying to deflect y'know responsibility. Um I I just think if we keep on this spiral of um attacking people all the time and um y'know looking to protect ourselves in militaristic sorts of ways ih it can only get worse  I really think we have to   as I said just stand firm and and continue to be fair to people.\n"," A lotta the experts say we really have no alternatives but to support the Americans um but I guess how far we do is  is a big question.\n"," Mm it's like well it's not we had no alternative but to go and fight in the Boer War and to go to Gallipoli y'know.\n"," The Maori wars . It ju it goes way back I mean.\n"," We do we do have choices y'know but I think fear often uh rules those choices for us.\n"," Yeah thanks Jill great to hear from you. Um it is true um but a lotta people saying well you have to be in an alliance it's uh you can't stand free of it and we are firmly wedged with the Americans the British and the Europeans although a lot of the Europeans seem to have broken loose of recent times. We welcome back West Australian listeners after the mid evening bulletin uh this is the NightLife and the issue of the day and tonight we're looking at uh terrorism and how it's likely to impact on everyday Australian life. Um some far reaching police powers to search arrest and detain people suspected of planning or committing terrorist acts are set to be strengthened in certain states and uh it is a very different atmosphere post Madrid. Peter um you're you're worried about our security.\n"," Well I'm concerned about I go to Spain fairly regularly and uh I've been reading the Spanish newspapers a couple of points I'd like to raise because  there seems to be a a breakdown in the Spanish intelligence services which is very bad. And uh there was no warning  that this was going to happen and uh it's amazing because the uh Spanish have a very very large police force as you probably know.\n"," Mm.\n"," And uh a very active intelligence system because Morocco is so close to them. Now a Al Qaeda assuming it was Al Qaeda   was able to outwit them and uh there's some funny business somewhere because it took them a very long time to get to that cell phone. In fact uh it took them quite a while and uh  then .\n"," I notice of the five suspects arrested three are Moroccans.\n"," Yeah but there was a long interval and they should have got to that to the source of that uh cell phone the sim card a lot quicker than they did. The Spanish people were protesting against Aznar because he had lied to them. And they didn't like that and they also were protesting because the intelligence services had failed and I would think that uh the question of lies uh might take us back to children overboard. And there might be a lesson there somewhere for this government.\n"," Mm   uh do do you think that Australia is in the firing line there is the potential for a a Madrid in Australia.\n"," Oh I think there's no doubt about that uh uh I read extensively and I follow everything on the internet and   I've never uh in the nine years or so that I've been on the internet m I've never seen Australia mentioned so often. And uh it's a bit spooky to to find yourself uh linked uh with this coalition. But um I mean that's life we've been taken there and um uh we have to live with it and I just hope and I have great faith in uh in uh Keelty the commissioner. I think he is a good man I think he's a very honest man and I think he's extremely bright. And he gives me a great deal of confidence therefore I shall um travel in uh public transport quite normally I'm not gunna be spooked by any of this but I think that uh the government may have led us into a very dangerous situation.\n"," Peter thanks for your thoughts Rick uh y you think the prime minister's talking up terror all the time.\n"," Yes I think um there's just been a a bit of a shift I've noticed in the last couple of days with Mr Howard um originally talking up the terrorist angle and using it I think in the same way as your previous caller talked about with the children overboard situation where it's a wedge politics to make people feel a sense of fear whether it's true or not. We all know now that it's true and as soon as this uh evidence comes back that it is true with things like the bombing in Madrid he seems to um take another tact and try and remove himself from having um any responsibility involved with um bringing Australia into this situation. I just think that your first caller originally when you first started this segment before the news spoke about multiculturalism and said that he felt it was a problem I think it's actually the key. I think an open hearts and open minds sort of attitude with an alternative to conflict and tension and the attention that can be gained through this sort of action needs to be defused I mean ten years ago this country was sort of put up on a pedestal was a model for the rest of the world in how well multiculturalism was working here  and in freedom of religion in freedom of speech and freedom of belief and and I just don't know where we're going. I think ten years ago we were on the right track and we had good relationships with our um neighbours in Asia and around the general region and I just think this move away to the right has been extremely damaging but I'm hoping that it's the last swing to the right that we get for some time because these things always seem to have a pendulum affect and I think we're swinging back the other way now and I think it's high time and I just hope that we haven't done too much damage that is irreversible.\n"," Thanks Rick great to hear from you um Jean Pierre you want a word about this as well you you believe we need to look at   why there is terrorism.\n"," Yes I mean like leh let's face it you can put uh uh whatever change whatever law you want up to this or that but I don't think it's gunna   uh influence a decision of somebody who's gunna decide to blow a bridge or anything like that . Um the the major part I took offence to the chap just before the news uh who seemed to blame the Muslim. And he he made a reference to his Jewish friend who has to close the door. Um we were all screaming our head off um uh in February last year or sometime last year because um Iraq had the twelve years to uh or ten years to   obey U N resolution but every for body seemed to forget that since nineteen-sixty-seven Israel has forgotten to um uh imply the uh is uh the United Nation resolution they must pull out of the West Bank and Palestine. And basically the whole Al Qaeda movement was based for that. If you take Bin Laden if you sort of study um his early beginning and all his whole life   he he only had two reasons for being it. First it was to overthrow the government in Saudi Arabia which is rotten and corrupt . Two to um prevent um Israel from destroying Palestine and therefore he was an eme enemy of the American. Right. Now if you don't need the problem pretty soon we will create a rift between the Christian and the Muslim which eventually uh the the Muslim country have a lesser living of standard than the western world and it's very easy for anybody who takes over down there to use the western world as a c scapegoat.\n"," Yes.\n"," You see what I mean by that and no law that you're gunna put no phone tapping no um. I mean if we go in phones they got a pirate solution they got this they got that they got tha it still happens.\n"," It is impossible to defend against somebody who's prepared to die for a cause.\n"," That's right and when you think about the intelligence from the America I mean American spent as as b I think the C I A on its own has a bih a forty billion budget but yet. Wha wha what what did they knew about Spain. Absolutely nothing . Right and uh we just can't cope to keep on saying we need America we need America we need America   I can't stuh uh uh stick  hang on America need us too you know. What about pine uh Pine Gap. Where they gunna put that  I mean that's a big part of their uh o of their anti espionage thing. What about the um the big um radar in uh near Canberra with the needs for the NASA and things like that . Y'know so ih it's not just saying y'know but we need America we need. We need to stand on our own two bloody two feet for a change you know sort of said where   you know sorry but you know this is not legal this is not moral this is uh the problem is a problem for the Middle East it was created   um with the Balfour resolution during the First World War. Uh it's it then it turn into lies after lies after lies until eventually um England uh wash uh their hand with uh with uh the Palestine solution and give it to the United Nation . Y'know and ih .\n"," Yeah uh ih it's a lot more complex than a lotta people are suspecting and uh and ye you're right y you p really have to look at the reasons for the terrorism uh ih as potentially I guess the the the main solution. Jean Pierre thanks for y for your thoughts on it. Magpie uh consistency is your issue.\n"," Don't you like what I put up on the board.\n"," Consistency.\n"," Well probably a few listeners wouldn't mind if a few black and white feathers flew but I don't think Bingar is a major target. Um H M A S Success in New Zealand . Feel very sorry for the crew because I have a feeling that there's some uh uh readjustments going on in uh routines over there. But that is just how simple this sort of thing can happen . Um even if they did write the right thing on the side of it. At first I don't think we have enough information exactly at this moment to to acknowledge who is behind it there may be some educated guesses.\n"," Well the European and Arab intelligence officials say the preliminary investigation and uh the interrogation of the five arrested   is really pointing heavily towards Al Qaeda.\n"," Only one of whom apparently is uh of interest the others were uh uh phone shop owners. Um I mean the for ooh I don't know there was a great organisation went on behind this incident uh the timing the the whole thing that was needed uh listening to someone there you needed to organise the uh coordinate have vehicles have   have h safe houses have escape routes so there was more than one involved uh it was a big organisation of some by some very clever person. Um we have been warned uh time and time again n Australia has been named um by this coalition of the willing is the alliance between the warnings and our vulnerability. Um but you see no weapons of mass destruction Tony have actually been found in Iraq which mea could be inferred that Iraq was actually complying with that U N resolution which the U S and its puppets used as an excuse to go into Iraq. So in actual fact ih it almost makes it an illegal act in itself uh after the event.\n"," Mm  well the the French and the Germans certainly thought that.\n"," Well precisely um   now   Mr Howard today said it wasn't neccessary to upgrade a warning colour but several uni uni European countries have gone from yellow to orange and one's gone to red . And.\n"," I think we were listed as being at medium level at this time.\n"," Well when Mr Howard was asked he said no it was not neccessary change. Alright everybody who have a fridge magnet what is the national security hotline number Tony . It's a good trivia question 'cos no one remembers it.\n"," Dear oh dear . You ask you do ask the tough questions. Thanks Magpie Warren uh ye you um an L P G tanker driver.\n"," Yes mate.\n"," And you've had some directives from your company.\n"," Yes I've been um we've been instructed by the company in writing as well as verbally um to be aware of what's around us we do a lotta late night deliveries.\n"," Yes.\n"," And we've been told be very careful. If we don't think it's safe to drive off. Um one of our drivers says what happens if we get confronted by people in vehicles and he won't let you drive over 'em if you have to. This is um .\n"," That's interesting.\n"," Yeah.\n"," A a and and what they're they're they're concerned that there is the possibility of  somebody trying to commandeer a vehicle and and do damage with it.\n"," Yeah well y'know like a forty-five-thousand litre L P G tank would make a helluva big hole in the ground.\n"," It would.\n"," And and um  we've been told be very careful and if we don't think it's safe to keep driving then call the authorities. Um I'm  out at the mo I'm out at the moment working. And w y'know w w w we go to some s pretty dark and horrible places in the middle of the night. And um y'know we're we're all concerned and  even our families are concerned 'cos y'know we we've gone back to our families and said been told to do this and um . Yeah.\n"," That is really scary.\n"," Yeah well it it would make a helluva mess I can tell you now  it'd make a helluva mess.\n"," Yeah that's reason to be concerned.\n"," 'Cos um 'cos um L P G is very very volatile even more than y'know your average unleaded fuel so uh it's . Yeah it's a bit worrying 'n' you you might say when you're driving the thing around all day.\n"," Absolutely Warren thanks for passing that on that's uh that's interesting   a new approach from a company when uh   when dealing with uh anybody who might approach an L P G tanker. Colin uh you you believe if we surrender to terror they're the winners.\n"," Oh of course uh you just have to have a look what's happening in Spain now . Uh the terrorist there now know that they can.\n"," Change governments.\n"," Government . And change government policy. And how can you do it you can do it through bombs . Um and that means they are now in the driving seat they are going to win this uh campaign. If the rest of us give up if the rest of us give in to them and I guess it's called a form of appeasement . Um I I find that very concerning and uh.\n"," It is a very difficult task this this uh declared war on terror from president George W Bush. Uh it's simply because it's such an amorphous mass . Uh it's h it's hard to know exactly where they are. Where they they thought that they knew where most of the training bases were in Afghanistan . Um I don't know whether they control much more than the Afghani capital. Uh and a and a small area around that.\n"," Well the Northern Alliance scar has a large slice of northern Afghanistan and that's nominally within the control of the alliance . Of of the sorry the coalition of the willing. Um uh y'know we shouldn't underestimate what has been achieved in Afghanistan certainly the   dreaded uh Taliban have gone.\n"," Oh  no no question that uh it was good to to have them departed but  uh y you you sort of wonder whether the American focus uh moved to Iraq and uh y'know basically let Afghanistan go.\n"," Oh true there there there's uh evidence in that I guess. Uh the point I would make though that we as a nation ha have been marked already. We were marked   at the time of our events in Afghanistan   um.\n"," We were also marked uh at East Timor.\n"," East Timor that's right and I would suggest that we were marked before that because   these people the terrorists they don't like who we are or what we stand for. And if we start surrendering and giving in to their   dictates their demands well they win and the world will be poorer for it.\n"," Thanks Colin great to hear from you uh Eve you uh you believe we've been at war with terror for uh a long time.\n"," Uh uh yes uh Tony I just heard you say before   well there's probably a reason for terrorism. There's no such a reason for terrorism it's a most insidious horrible thing. Now uh uh uh what that foreman meh Colin said uh uh that the new socialist government is going to appease these terrorists so that any time in the future uh any country's going to have an election they'll boh blow up a few uh trains and dictate who's going to govern the country . So all your listeners who who   y'know it's always they get on to have this shot at John Howard anyway   uh th they will come on and say oh what wuh y'know we've got wuh t terrorism ih you blame the Americans you blame   the English and you bla blame the Australians uh uh can you remeh you wouldn't remember sixty years ago when Hitler tried to take over the world. And and Japan and our allies went and fought them otherwise Hitler wuh wuh would've taken over the whole world. You you don't give in to them Tony . Now uh I I I really can't believe all these people that are blaming the coalition uh for for going to war with Iraq and and these other countries these fundamentalist Islamic terrorist   and y'know I I will justify which uh uh we're all required to to say not all Muslims are terrorists   but there's a lot of them who hate Christians. Uh the ye y'know all you people who come on and defend these people uh that uh you're getting the message aren't you that they hate Christians and we are at war with them.\n"," Mm well I I think there's a war on terrorism I don't think there's a war against m uh uh Islam. Uh it's uh it it it is a a y'know a conflict that   uh is based on uh Osama Bin Laden and his uh connections that uh are determined to   y'know make radical changes in  the Middle East and America.\n"," They're promising they're going to take over the world and kill the infidels is that correct. That's a war isn't it . So what do you do. Do you just sit back and let them take over the world.\n"," Yes I I think that uh y'know th they can disrupt the world I don't think they can take over the world it's not it's not like they've got an army like uh Adolf Hitler had behind him and y'know the he had the potential to take over the world. And I think y'know this is a group that can rock the world certainly but not uh not not uh uh y'know dem uh commandeer us.\n"," Any anyway Tony I I'm I'm just   uh fearful of the people that we now have in Australia   who've just uh wih wih with their provincial political thinking blame everything on John Howard I think he's a very brave man. Uh who has taken on these terrorists like two-hundred Australians uh uh were blown up three-thousand Americans were blown up uh two hundred uh uh Spanish people were blown up the other day so what do we do. Do we appease them or do we go to war against terrorism . I think that's the main question people should be asking.\n"," Thanks very much for your point of view uh Dawn you you believe the prime minister's correct.\n"," Yes I do and I'm so pleased to hear Colin and Eve thinking correctly. I n I know for one that I don't want to have to walk down the street wheeling my grandchild thinking can't I take him in there or can't I take him there. I wanna enjoy his time with me while I'm alive  and I and my grandchildren to come and as as far as defending Australia I think people are are it amazed me I they're the   the islalelu  the Islamic race is winning. Uh they they have already won it is a war terrorism is a war and they're they're already winning they do have the means   you say they can't take over the world.\n"," Well I mean th they doh they don't have the means to to y'know dominate the world at this time.\n"," Well sneaking into places and bombing bombing innocent people   blowing hundreds of people up at a time I mean  that's good odds isn't it.\n"," Yeah well it certainly rocks the world there is no question of it and I mean everybody is firmly focussed on what happened in Spain I mean uh ih it was terrible I mean these people were uh poor workers they were uh y'know um uh students they were every everyday average people who were  who were killed by this uh  terrorist outrage.\n"," Can you think of a place in Australia where they couldn't get to. You could you think of place in Australia that's safe. And what if they were so well organised that they could choo asy as a caller previously said uh they could use telephones to ignite these bombs from long distances away. I mean they could do twenty thirty places at a time . It must have taken a lot of organisation for those people to get the planes to work in places where they could be trusted y'know in America and then all of a sudden that great disaster I mean there were thousands killed there. And those people were going into people's homes as friends . I I can't believe that people can be so naive   as n as I mean I look at it almost as treason when you go against your own country and I think John Howard is a is a very brave man and I think we've got the right man at the helm he   nothing rocks him where he can think he can think evenly about things every every problem that's thrown at him in this situation he's very s he's a steadfast person he stands stands there  and protects our country and and makes decisions that that affect us every day that keep us safe. Uh I I think people are are choosing a game of dice they're throwing it in the air and saying yes we'll choose this it's like barracking for a football team. They get a they get an idea into their head and they think oh yeah this is good this'll be good but not one of those people would be willing to say   I bet you if he said come on stand up with me and protect our country they wouldn't. I have a son who's just come out of the army he's now in the police force and he was overseas. And I I dread to think I have another son as well that they would stand up there and protect people like these. And what would they do what would they have done if they had've if there had've been and I still believe there were weapons somewhere I believe that he had a l it's a huge place over there and he had a lotta countries   as allies to put those weapons long long ago uh otherwise why wouldn't he let them come in straight away and look.\n"," Alright Dawn thanks for that uh good to hear from you James you you believe that fear is taking over uh.\n"," g'day mate um good conversation tonight. Yeah I was in England got back just over a year ago  on a working holiday visiting relatives. Caught the tube from Padding to Waterloo 'n'  mate I hated it  it was awful . And it wasn't me and and um one thing I learned and my family and friends told me is that   people weren't very friendly and people don't say hello and I just hate the idea that 'cos I grew up in Sydney. I just hate the idea that it's gunna become like that 'cos I remember Sydney as a happy friendly city and   people say g'day y'know just   just and then they're achieving what they want to achieve just just by that and I just hope that it doesn't become that way because I thought it was awful. And I found myself becoming that way. I'd see a bag a bag or baggage on the train and no one near it. Y'know.\n"," You'd move away.\n"," And I'd go uhp  no I wouldn't I'd go who's that belong to .\n"," Oh okay.\n"," Where's that come from  and I'd I'd watch it. And and all the warnings and the and the alerts over the over the network and and the voice overs and things and it does get to you and I just  hate to think that.\n"," I mean ih ih terrorism isn't brand new here either I mean we y you only have to think back to uh what was it nineteen-seventy-eight the CHOGM conference at the Hilton hotel in Sydney. The  the bomb that went off outside of the Hilton . Um so it's it's and y'know we've we've had an explosion at uh the police  headquarters in in Adelaide we've had uh  the uh y'know and and Bali o obviously even though it wasn't  on Australian territory it was almost de facto Australian territory.\n"," It was yeah yeah. I I just I just don't like the the idea that that we might become very unfriendly people and suspicious and a bit paranoid about   where we go and what we do and I just hope it doesn't become that way 'cos that's what I experienced in England and I didn't like it at all basically .\n"," Yeah I know I I understand exactly what you're saying James thanks uh Steve you you're concerned about the increased powers issue you have a bit of a problem with uh unlimited powers.\n"," Yes very much so actually soon I'll be more scared of uh uh t uh the police than the terrorists . Because um if they suddenly have powers holding you without arrest and all of that it um   takes off uh the pressure on the police to actually uh be a bit more um thorough in their investigation. They can just hold you because oh you look like a terrorist and suddenly um you could be in their custody for a period of time which can affect uh your family life  once I find that you are in custody you uh tend to um uh you you feel that you're powerless and uh with uh with them being able to say well you can come here and uh we don't ha even have to charge you with anything.\n"," Mm I don't think they're thinking about uh a replica of Guantanamo Bay I don't think it's gunna be quite that ruthless but uh what they're saying is that what they'd need to do probably is hold   uh terror suspects for longer than we would normally hold criminal suspects for and be able to investigate them fully otherwise uh y'know it is it's it's possible that the authorities are gunna miss certain facts uh that could be critical.\n"," I've no problems there but these laws seems to be uh cutting across the whole board whole spectrum  so therefore I mean yes that might be a good law for today and everybody sort of understands but suddenly .\n"," It's on the books and so therefore it's there forever.\n"," That's right and therefore some policeman may have a small grudge against you maybe nothing major but suddenly he holds you for four hours or how many hours he's allowed to hold you whatever the case may be. It's just something and then lets you go you've got no recourse unless you've got good lawyers . And um  y'know money y'know you let these things go and I find that there should be I mean I I believe they should have powers and I believe they have a lot of powers. Mm but I think there there's gotta be a very tight scrutiny and like the last uh powers that were introduced with ASEO the only people that really scrutinised them were the Greens and at the end of the whole lot I actually wasn't quite satisfied um where the powers would end and and and I wasn't clear where what the powers actually were . And that's uh.\n"," So you the you you think it's important to underline the fact that it's still a democracy.\n"," Yes very much so and uh I believe they do have uh quite extensive powers now and just by giving more and more powers to the police actually creates more fear of the police than it does of the terrorists.\n"," Alright Steve thanks for your view Greg you uh have a general comment on on terror.\n"," Yes uh Tony.\n"," G'day Greg.\n"," I I was very impressed with the comments of uh Colin Steve and that other lady uh we're talking here raw patriotism and uh and I'm not taking away from the others who have a genuine belief in what they believe in they they believe in appeasement and so on. But my attitude is I go though a path and when I walk through Perth I I go through a sign that says those deserve peace who are prepared to defend it. Now that doesn't mean to say that I'm a warmonger . What I'm saying is if someone threatens my country I'm a defensive person not an offensive person  if someone threatens my country I'm right behind whichever political party is prepared to pick up the gear and go and I will do that I'll defend Bob Brown I'll say Bob righto Bob you wouldn't wanna pick up a a an M sixteen with me. I've gotta defend you and your family and you're gunna roll over uh and say y'know please don't hurt me it's uh ih uh I'm a good bloke. I said that that isn't the way these poor fanatics think . And I said the bottom line is that that sort of action those guys have got and they are fanatics and they are off the beam and .\n"," Well ih it makes it also very hard to defend against simply because you don't know exactly where they're going to go next.\n"," No and and of course if if they come into our territory any of these folks that do that then I say we need whatever powers that the government needs to defend against that I am only too happy to support it because I can walk through. They can arrest me any time they want to. I can walk through there I know that I will come out the other end okay. Now some of those blokes are a little worried about that. Think about it because um uh in our judicial system ih in the Westminster system of government we have a predication of innocence before guilt  and uh I uh I uh I think I couldn't put it better than Colin Eve and that other lady . And I won't try and go over that ground again Tony.\n"," But uh as far as you're concerned  we we we should uh.\n"," protecting my country and my family and  my grandkids.\n"," Y you believe we should be taking a a very aggressive uh investigative.\n"," it's not so much aggressive but a very positive stance towards protecting our country and we don't roll over and just lie down and go for appeasement. That's not my game and I I will support any government and I guarantee there's an awful lotta people behind me   that that says we will use whatever powers we have to to protect our kith and kin.\n"," Tt good to hear from you Greg thanks for that uh Tom you you believe public gatherings   could be a possible target here.\n"," Yes Tony. I just listened to that man and a couple of women before him   and I wonder where they live. Um   here in Toowoomba I I doubt that we've got any cause to worry because there are no gatherings big enough anywhere in toowoom  we don't have a train service . Sydney and Melbourne could be concerned about it but why about transport when they have for instance in Melbourne they have an anything up to ninety-thousand people gathered together for a game of football.\n"," Mm oh it's something we have to look at too I mean  y'know major sporting gatherings that sort of thing it ih y'know they all could be potential targets.\n"," But how do you guard against people who are prepared to blow themselves to pieces to take somebody else with them.\n"," Well I don't think you can.\n"," And I heard I heard a a few of your callers talking about   them the terrorists have done this to these innocent people in Spain. What the hell do they think that the coalition of the willing did   to innocent people in Afghanistan and and Iraq . Y'know and and as one of your callers said   nobody is dib is being bothered to find out why they are terrorists why they are doing this sorta stuff. How can you defeat something if you don't know why they're doing it . And and when they talk about a war against terrorism   you you can't win a war against terrorism you have to find some other way of doing it. And that doesn't mean rolling over and appeasement and all the rest of it. And uh I don't know where they get the idea that   um Bob Brown or Labor is prepared to roll over and and and appease the terrorists uh uh it's all I I I don't know I don't know where they   they they must just reach up into the m into into air and grab these things out out of mid air because.\n"," A l a lotta people believe that um y'know we shouldn't have been in Iraq in the first place  uh and and I think um y'know that's th th that's the attitude that they're reflecting.\n"," Tony John Howard said that that as far as he's concerned there's no link between uh the spai Spanish troops going into Iraq and and the bombing . Uh the majority of Spaniards don't agree with him. They they uh thought enough about it to uh ousted the government that took them into that. And uh uh I I don't kno I d I don't know you know   when they talk about Iraq   an and I heard Bush talking about protecting America from an attack by Iraq. And and we we're in this this sorta stuff too. Iraq was never a threat to us . And yet but we we attack it we we invade it without without any warning and and now we've we've got we've got people we've got people in Guantanamo Bay and as far as I'm I can see the most that they could charge them with is defending themselves against an armed attack.\n"," Yeah I think it'll be m little little more serious than that Tom by the sound of the uh military tribunal   but thank thanks for your thoughts Ian uh y y you believe we shouldn't run up a white flag under any circumstances.\n"," under no cir  pardon me g'day Tony under no cir uh circumstances  um I mean we are we're fighting people in these in these terrorists how I'd label them . They are they are diabolically evil they are fanatical and they are cowardly. And ih h the appeasement will will uh serves nothing. Wih wih they are utterly utterly committed to their cause and they pervert a noble religion Islam in so doing. Islam is not all about this. This is a perversion of it  the w the what they're what they are doing.\n"," Mm Osama Bin Laden's version is a very different one from  the Koran.\n"," Very different from what you'd find in the Koran and   very different from what would be preached by a a a balanced and scholarly uh mufti I'm sure . But um.\n"," I I understand your comment.\n"," Ih it's we we we just simply have to stand firm ap appeasement has never worked I mean look at look at history I mean yes yes there were innocent people were killed so were innocent people killed in the second world war but did we should we will we we feel constrained in our fight against imperial Japan and Nazi Germany because innocent people were going to be killed in bombing raids or shelling or whatever  no. Uh tragically this is part of war. And I have  um my life was  profoundly changed uh mm by the loss of my uncle in the second world war but that's that's another matter th so I mean I have no I have no reason to to be uh.\n"," A supporter of conflict but mm.\n"," War but I neither am I a pacifist but it. I've had to be realistic . I mean this is an occasion where we simply have to take up arms  we have to be alert and we we really I mean it it's going to be a I don't uh I don't think anybody you one would be a fool to imagine one could this could be something that could be won as it were overnight. It's going to be a protracted protracted affair.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COMNE3-plain.txt:\n","\n"," We are Talking Real Estate on eight-eighty-two Six P R thank you Len and good morning to Craig Turnbull from Aspire how are you mate.\n"," Good morning Harvey and good morning Perth the answer is fantastic.\n"," Fantastic that's very very good indeed nice uh day it'll be a bit later on to uh go out 'n' have a look at um well first of all the uh Eagles probably whacking the Hawks unfortunately   but also to go 'n' have a look at real estate today.\n"," Yeah great day to be uh in real estate ab absolutely I think the sun'll be out and uh not too hot and uh good time to be out there uh there's not that much on the market right now Harvey uh only about seven-thousand statistih statistically speaking and that's quite a lot less than than what's normally uh the case normally luh in a inverted commas average market there's about twelve-thousand 'n' what it means is there's a lot of competition for uh the good property out there. Uh lotta my mentoring students 'n' people that I that we deal with are saying Craig w y'know wuh we're putting our offers in 'n' 'n' getting beaten because uh the market's still very strong out there.\n"," Yeah it is. There's no doubt about that still going s going gang busters really isn't it. And uh no sign of slowing it doesn't seem.\n"," No uh it hasn't I look it hasn't been a crazy market Harvey but it's been steadily strong 'n' that's actually that that's quite good. I think uh overall um the rest of Australia is complaining that um real estate market's gone quiet but it's not the case over here. There's lot of indicators which uh show us it'll keep continuing Harvey I think all going well all things being equal that is. Uh and one of those is uh on the paper today Harvey. It's on page eleven  Perth house rents jump fourteen per cent  this year. That's quite incredible uh what they're saying is the median house rent now for a home is two-hundred-and-seventeen-dollars a week and um units d rose sixteen per cent to a hundred-and-fifty-nine. There's a lot going on um lot of high quality homes being built which is lifting the median price and also um there is been a sharp rise in rental uh sorta take up rates um vacancy rate's fallen Harvey from two years ago where it was four per cent down to two-point-six per cent now what that means is there's there's less homes available for renters to take up . And as there's less 'n' less available prices start to move up . Now at three per cent uh that's like the market balance. Uh and anything under that means r rents will continue to move up so as long as the vacancy rate's tight like that rents'll go up and uh people who are renting uh look I'm sorry folks the rents will keep moving up.\n"," I was gunna say people who're gunna read this that have got investment properties are gunna say hang on I haven't put the rent up for a couple of years I'm gunna do so now.\n"," That that's correct  that's quite correct lotta s prop lotta property managers out there will be going oh gee I haven't lifted thah lifted our rents lately  and in the next reviews they'll all be going up now what else this does is that uh it means investors are gunna look at this and go oh we can get a better rent return . Because the last couple years uh prices have moved up quite a bit but rents haven't followed. And it means that the rent returns f on the investment have been l have been low or getting getting smaller.\n"," Yes people that have been uh for example buying uh let's say a two-hundred-thousand dollar investment property uh you should be getting y'know f this is what we've learned over the years uh two-hundred dollars a week rent but they've been getting around about say the one-eighty one-eighty-five mark now.\n"," Or or even less.\n"," Yeah and now they're gunna go like two-ten two-fifteen  that's how I read that.\n"," It's completely possible  um the the Perth rents have traditionally been a little bit low. I think uh compared the rest of the country but it ih it is catching up  so um for those of you out there sitting thinking that maybe that you'll wait around 'n' just keep renting and you wait for the price of property to come down I I can't see it not in the  in the immediate short term. Barring interest rate doubling tomorrow night   and I'm not saying that's gunna happen of course but uh the the market everything everything all the indicators for our market are quite strong Harvey.\n"," Mm. Alright uh give us a call nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two or real estate at six P R dot com dot A U real estate at six P R dot com dot A U you can call us now get in nice 'n' early as I've been exhorting you to do and um I'm surprised you've had time to pop in this morning you're a busy lad at the moment how's the s the seminar going.\n"," Great we started last night I've got a group of sixty very excited happy people all learning about real estate 'n' themselves 'n' how to invest 'n' plans 'n' strategies 'n' they're learning stuff they never thought that that that they would  and we've got two full days as soon as I finish here I'll be racing off down to the to the technology park function centre 'n' they'll be there waiting so that's g great. I only get to do it once a year  these days um there was a time early in uh my education career where we're doing it four or five times a year but these days we've got our mentoring groups we've got our finance broking we've got our prop property find our project marketing and we're looking at some land investments there's there's so much happening for us right now Harv I just don't get to do this any more than once a year.\n"," Yeah alright and uh you go today and tomorrow as well.\n"," Today and tomorrow  two 'n' a half full days which is great so very excited about it.\n"," Alright well I must pop into one of those one of these days so that I'll know what you're not ness I'm I haven't got any extra cash at the moment that is for sure but having said that just to see uh y'know what it's like.\n"," What we do  Harvey you'd always be welcome.\n"," Alright lovely. Okay uh Isaac of Merriwa you're welcome too to uh call us or you have. Good morning Isaac.\n"," Good morning how are you .\n"," Good morning Isaac fantastic.\n"," Oh that's good um I was just ringing up to find out what your opinion would be about the northern corridor sort of around   noh or north of Clarkson um Merriwa all those sort of areas. Um wuh within the next say three four years. I've got a house I've already bought um last year and I'll probably be selling it about say another three four years when I move.\n"," Okay so you're talking about Clarkson 'n' m and Merriwa.\n"," Uh Merriwa  yeah.\n"," Well look if you'd asked me ten years ago  about Clarkson or Merriwa I would have said well just try and avoid it because um when they first developed the area ten fifteen years ago there was they they they had inexpensive blocks and filled up by inexpensive homes and the developers at the time didn't put any y'know limestone walls in to level the blocks up some of them are like sides of mountains  and um they were all cut and filled and uh it didn't look attractive and the homes weren't the best available 'n' I would've said well y'know try 'n' steer clear but  um these days uh l like the the latter part of the developments have been really good  and pricewise very inexpensive compared  with what's around it like Clarkson the median price is only two-hundred-and-ten-thousand currently  a and uh Merriwa uh it's not much more than that I think it's actually yeah actually bang on two-ten as well so  what's happening is you've got Mindarie's been revitalised  and there's new shopping centres gone in there you've got the freeway being extended 'n' the railway line's on its way up there . So those two things the freeway and the railway will make a massive difference  to Merriwa and Clarkson and at two-ten-thousand it's now looking pretty cheap actually . So I think you'll find if you if you look at I mean there's there's areas within areas there's suh  some parts of Clarkson Merriwa Merriwa which are looking really good so that'd be a fantastic spot to hang onto  particularly with the railway and freeway o unuh on the way.\n"," Yeah you don't know how far the freeway's going up do you.\n"," Uh look I gotta look at my map here. It's on it's way up to I think it's cuh th Currambine now is the the railway that is. My understanding is they plan to push it right through well  way past that but uh  how when I don't know. Um  there there's talk that in future it'll end up at Yanchep but I mean I'd I don't know.\n"," Yeah but they're concentrating on the Kwinana freeway extension at the moment  obviously but yeah .\n"," They they can only do one thing at a time.\n"," The railway goes all the way to Clarkson now the station's already open.\n"," Okay good that well  that that's good news  and but the but the freeway's coming.\n"," Yeah that's right yeah alright thanks for that.\n"," Yeah so look I mean hang on and uh I think thah y'know it's inexpensive real estate compared to what's around it.\n"," Good  on you thanks Isaac uh good little pocket up there by the way is a little suburb now called Ridgewood. I know a bit about this 'cos I well I had two kids living there at one stage I've still got one living there. And uh Ridgewood was uh part of Merriwa. It was uh the old Carnegie Heights estah I think it was Carnegie Heights or ss cuh Carnegie something anyway estate and uh Ridgewood is is quite a nice little sorta suburb within a suburb if if you like 'n'  uh mm.\n"," Well look at the difference Harv ih with with um Merriwa Clarkson the your median price is at two-ten . Now in Ridgewood which is right in the middle it's two-forty-seven  and a half. Quite  quite a bih quite a big difference  because that was like one of the later stages  so to speak and they learnt their lessons from first the first part of that developments and it's ih done at a much higher standard and the prices reflect that.\n"," Yeah. I was house-sitting up there uh for my daughter 'n' son-in-law when they went up to Singapore for a little holiday and uh it's funny because   it was only for a few days but you get kinda used to having a a good look at the suburb again . And I thought this is a l nice little jewel in the crown of uh those those suburbs at the moment.\n"," Yeah very much the same as um there's a suburb uh in the middle of Currambine I guess it's not really a suburb like an estate in the middle of Currambine called Somerly  and that's been put together very much like um Subi Centro in East Perth . And uh that's actually looking quite quite good as well. It's still a part of um tt uh sorta Currambine and Clarkson but uh it's it's called they've given a name 'n' they've given it an identity and uh prices there are quite a bit higher than what's around it.\n"," Yep okay nice little place to have a look at alright let's go to Como hello Joan.\n"," Oh good morning Harvey good morning Craig.\n"," Good morning Joan.\n"," It's gunna be a lovely day I hope.\n"," Absolutely.\n"," Yeah it looks lovely out there um I was just wondering what suburbs like you were saying Somerly but what prices did you say they're about two-forty-seven per um apartment are they.\n"," Nuh uh well they're  yeah there is there is an apartment complex going up in Currambine  prih prices starting at two-hundred-thousand 'n' that's that's right next to the railway there . We we said Ridgewood was two-forty-seven and a half as the median price that's the middle price.\n"," Yes.\n"," So half the sales were less than that 'n' half the sales were more than that just the middle price . 'Cos median price is a good guide.\n"," Oh right the medium price  and that is in um the suburb is again.\n"," That was Ridgewood.\n"," Ridgewood that's  right yes. 'Cos they're all sorta new I haven't always heard some of these before y'know I don't travel a huge amount  but with um the rental 'n' that it makes it a little bit hard 'n' if they're students the young people um they trying to find accommodation because they don't they c it's not always convenient to sort of young people that come from the country or wherever uh or s perhaps they're from other countries they don't always have a chance to um get accommodation every um kind of as students there is always a kind of overflow if you know what of young people trying to get accommodation.\n"," That's true and it's a bit of a challenge even more in the coming uh uh market Joan because vanc vacancy rate's very tight  and uh yeah it means rents are going up for it's evuh even more challenging for them.\n"," Yes that's right but I'm interested in reading that book of yours that you've got three books haven't you.\n"," I have yes.\n"," Yes okay.\n"," Have you got them.\n"," I'm sorry.\n"," Do you have the books or.\n"," Um no I was going to ha um try 'n' get the first one I  thought.\n"," Joan wuh there's three books the first one or the the beginning one so to speak is called It's Easy to Invest in Property.\n"," Easy to invest .\n"," It's Easy toh yeah that's that's for if you have got not a lot of knowledge about property that's a good one to start at that's a twenty dollar book . And then the next one's called It's Easy to be a Property Millionaire . And then the more advanced one is called Unlimited Cashflow.\n"," Unlimited Cashflow .\n"," Yeah now you can get any of those books any of those books from uh Angus and Robertson or Dymocks or Collins  um   or if you wanna buy all three together you could ring our office on Monday morning 'n' get a special package price.\n"," Uh at the office okay.\n"," Yeah and that's uh.\n"," Are you under your name aren't you.\n"," Yeah uh Craig Turnbull yes.\n"," Yes.\n"," So you could  go hunt those books out from ol almost anywhere or give our office a call on Monday.\n"," Good on you thanks for your call Joan it's sixteen minutes past seven.\n","\n","\n"," Okay it's twenty-four minutes past seven plenty of calls on the board Craig so let's get to them. Mary of Two Rocks g'day Mary.\n"," Ah g hi how you guys  going this morning.\n"," Hi Mary thanks for waiting.\n"," Uh listen I'm just wondering um you're probably aware of what's happening up here with Capricorn the Harford Grove and Lindsays Beach . And then uh that's down like towards Yanchep and then there's The Reef the all those blocks are opening soon I'm just wondering uh a lot of the uh blocks down at the Yanchep end are those cottage blocks two-hundred-and-thirty square metres.\n"," Yes.\n"," And then that then they seem to go up to about four-hundred there's one for seven-hundred-and-four square metres 'n' then a couple of two-thousand. I don't know what's gunna happen with The Reef but I'm just wondering how do you think this will affect uh like we're in Two Rocks we're in the yachting village. Would that tend to put the values up or drop them a bit. When all that development happens.\n"," I would tend to think Mary that that would increase values 'n' I'll tell you why. Um people who are buying the smaller blocks um oh actuh all those those homes that'll be built there will probably be pretty high quality  and depending on the covenants that the the developers have put on the on the land um uh I would think that that you've gotta build a certain quality and certain size home so what that tends to to do is lift the overall quality uh of housing in the area so uh uh prices will follow so.\n"," Right ih.\n"," I l I I think Yanchep and Two Rocks really needs that kind of developmys  myself.\n"," Yes uh what do you think uh do you know anything about what's happening with The Reef that's that's right uh on the border on the uh farmlands at Two Rocks there.\n"," Mary I don't I I really don't.\n"," No.\n"," No I'm sorry.\n"," Alright then.\n"," Okay Mary thank you uh let's go to Abe of Rivervale hello Abe.\n"," How're ya good morning gentlemen um  just just a question about uh we're looking to buy a property for the family to live in ourselves and uh we're looking at the suburb of Lynwood. What uh what are we what would we be looking at in terms of paying for a home there a three by one or a three by two.\n"," Ih good question um the median price in Lynwood as at March was two-hundred-'n'-five-thousand we're waiting for the June figures out 'n' I suspect Lynwood would have jumped quite a bit. Um two-oh-five sounds very very very very very cheap and I I think that that's got some real up upside in it compared to like what's around it like Langford's one-eighty-two uh you got other areas um Parkwood around it um y'know higher again than that so I think Lynwood's looking pretty cheap right now. Other thing with Lynwood is um the Lynwood Arms is gunna be I think part of it gunna be taken down and uh brand new townhouses're gunna be built there um Abe Saffron's just got that underway 'n' those townhouses'll be in a b sorta three-hundred-thousand plus price bracket so I I think that um Lynwood is great value so you probably looking probably for an like an like an average home in a good condition in Lynwood probably two-twenty to two-fifty I'd say something in in that range.\n"," Right right  excellent.\n"," Yeah is that that work for you.\n"," Yeah wuh well we've looked at a couple 'n' we're there's one that's a like a more of a an older home nineteens-fifties that's in our price range roughly and but it's on a big block like a nine-hundred square metre block.\n"," Yes.\n"," And uh they're the price would I'm just trying to find out what whether these p whether they're inflating the price or if it's reasonable they're looking at about two-thirty two-hundred-'n'-thirty-thousand for the home it's a three by two. So it's an older.\n"," Is there much mah much work to do on the home Abe.\n"," Um just just uh the roof needs to be replaced probably 'cos it's asbestos . But it's a it's a solid brick uh brick home uh floor tiles are it's painted it's already painted floor tile uh the it's got dark wooden floorboards uh and and a big uh backyard with a  with a with a uh concrete pool cement pool in it.\n"," Eh but it's not it's not bad value just get that roof changed 'n' and you'll be set I think.\n"," Right excellent  okay thanks very much.\n"," You're welcome matey . Let's head off to Kenwick g'day Christine.\n"," Oh good morning uh  I'd uh I'd just like to know about the values in Kenwick I heard you speaking about the one on Anaconda Drive in in um Gosnells. My place is about the same sound sounded about the same anyway. But we have a granny flat instead of the workshop. So I I just wondered where we were in Kenwick.\n"," Okay well median price that's the middle price in Kenwick uh as of March was a hundred-'n'-seventy-six-thousand. The lowest price was a hundred-'n'-sixty-seven so there's obviously a lot of lotta homes being sold in that price bracket and the the high price is five-hundred-'n'-fifty. Lotta activity out in Kenwick uh at the moment um uh t to get anything decent uh is getting much much harder under two-hundred-thousand these days.\n"," Yeah we  we keep getting real estate people offering to sell .\n"," Of course yeah because th they're all chasing listings 'cos there isn't much available out there so um people putting their homes on the market right now are starting to get y'know pretty good prices. Where you'd be look I don't know without seeing your property but I'd certainly say two-hundred plus but how far more than that I just don't know without seeing it so get get three appraisals written appraisals 'n' see what they say.\n"," Yeah.\n"," And oh  the highest one isn't always the best Christine.\n"," Thanks Christine ah before the headlines Carl of Maylands g'day Carl.\n"," Yeah g'day Craig and Harvey how you going.\n"," Fantastic Carl.\n"," Uh just want to ask you Craig uh what you know about the Mangles Bay development down there at Rockingham.\n"," Carl absolutely nothing . Where where is it.\n"," It's uh it's heading towards y'know that the bridge that goes across to Garden Island.\n"," Yes I know the bridge very well.\n"," If you go onto the um Rockingham Development Authority's uh website there's something on there about Mangles Bay 'n' they're putting forward proposals to build a marina there and possibly c uh canals I think.\n"," Sorry now I know where you're talking about yeah  look look I I have heard of it but they're facing some stiff opposition from the locals  uh environmentals um and so on but uh there's a big push behind that particular section and in time it it will happen I think it should happen given that they can take care of all the environmental side of things  um I think it would really help uh Rockingham uh go ahead so keep your eye on that   the way to make money outta that kind of uh development is to get in there beforehand it's a risk because it's not a given it may or may not happen  mm but there's a bit of a a y'know there's a strong push behind that one so I I suspect in time ih it'll go ahead but I mean I I don't know for sure.\n"," Okay I've actually got a townhouse down there at Palm Beach so you think it's worth holding onto.\n"," Oh yes . Absolutely yeah yeah hang on to that one.\n"," Great thank you for that.\n"," Cheers.\n"," Good on you Carl thank you for your call bye.\n"," Bye.\n","\n","\n"," Worth waiting for wasn't it twenty-four minutes to eight o'clock nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two or real estate at six P R dot com dot A U. We've got Riaz has sent us a an email which we'll get to in a minute but Tony of Darch has been waiting on forever on the phone g'day Tony.\n"," How's it going.\n"," Good.\n"," Hi Tony.\n"," Hi how's it going I was just wanting to ask you a question um have you heard of a estate in Stirling called civling guh Civic Gardens Estate.\n"," Uh that's just right next to the um the old council building yes.\n"," Yeah that one there what do you reckon about that that's that little bit of l that little pocket there.\n"," Well uh uh  I th yeah.\n"," Blocks are about three-hundred-and-eighty square metres.\n"," Yes.\n"," And you have to put the the garages at the back 'n' the actual y'know no garage at the front but thah garah like a Subi Centro style.\n"," Yes.\n"," With the little laneway at the back what do you  what what'd something be worth   what would the house be worth at the end of the day when it's all done . The blocks are about two-twenty to buy.\n"," Yes.\n"," 'N' then you gotta put ih and you can't put single-storey you have to go up on three-hundred-'n'-eighty square metres.\n"," Yeah uh what then what you'll find is then that uh  your prices probably end up between four five-hundred-thousand something like that. Um and look that little pocket of land there is like it really   for all intents and purposes shouldn't be residential it's like it's been created out of out of nothing and uh to get land like that in the middle of Stirling uh is not an easy thing to do and you will find that um creating land like that is is kind of unique and that's why they're they can get the prices they want it's r y'know just back from the freeway you're not far from y'know Karrinyup shopping centre y'know ten minutes from the beach you've ten minutes from town I think locationwise it's it's pretty good and uh what they are creating there is a high quality subdivision that'll uh be uh wuh will attract uh big houses 'n' people wih with big wallets so I think that uh if it is built the way I think it's gunna be built it could be terrific pih piece of real estate.\n"," Thank you very much indeed Tony uh Riaz as I said wrote to us. \n"," Look I don't know what the exact prices are uh in Settlers Hill but uh Baldivis the the median prices are just jumping like crazy which is quite incredible. Um y we're looking at around about three-hundred-'n'-twenty-five-thousand as a median price 'n' that's what I mean the blocks are probably one-thirty to one-sixty kind of in that range 'n' then you're spending that again on a home so y with three-hundred three-twenty-thousand for ol almost like a first home out there. Most of 'em are being built four by two quite big homes and and mm ih they're all relatively high quality. Uh but Baldivis for mine 'n' Settlers Hill it sort of   I don't know it seems like a long way from anywhere for me. For mine um not down near the water it's just off the freeway I guess it's only like like a half hour trip into town. But uh I'm I'm not quite sure why the the prices are suh are so high there it's just  it's beyond me actually.\n"," Okay uh Paul of Connolly g'day Paul.\n"," Yeah g'day guys how are youse.\n"," Hey  Paul.\n"," Um yeah we just got a um uh situation we had couple of investment properties and our place um in Heathridge and we've sold one of the investment properties and our place and moved to um Connolly uh we've still got our investment property in Scarborough I was just didn't know whether we'd be best off um selling that   'cos all the equity's sort of in in the um the unit we've got in Scarborough   selling that 'n' sort of putting the money back into our own place 'n' then buying another investment property . Which we can fully negative gear.\n"," Yeah good question um there's a lotta things to s consider there number one what tax will you pay if if and when you pa you sell Scarborough that's one thing to consider. Um at the moment if you've got a big loan on Connolly and no loan on the Scarborough property well that's all back to front. Ideally as you put it uh you all your debt you want against property you're renting out so it's all tax-deductible so that's ideal.\n"," Yeah just tha tha tha that's the situation we've got where you don't know   you're looking at paying about thirty-thousand capital gains tax if we sell the unit in Scarborough.\n"," Yeah so how much is that gunna hurt you versus what you'll save  if you sold Scarborough used that money to pay your own home in Connolly off and then used the equity in Connolly to go again  um it it's a matter of sitting down and working the numbers Paul and perhaps getting some some accounting advice.\n"," Yeah where can you go to get accuh accounting advice 'cos I mean I've I've tried to find people 'n' they always try and sell you either houses or a development they're doing or they um.\n"," Okay.\n"," Know what I mean it's like there's no one out there who actually does that sort there's not that I can find anyway.\n"," Yeah look there you're you're right there're very few but look these days to survive in business you've gotta have more than one uh arrow ih in your quiver 'n' that's what what um suh the added value services are all about. Um look any number of ways you c you could look at it but if you want to know who my accountant is y would you like to know that or.\n"," Yeah yeah.\n"," Yeah guy named Nigel Plowman and he operates  his company's called McKinley Plowman  and they're up at Joondalup and.\n"," actually.\n"," Oh is he.\n"," Yeah believe it or not.\n"," Go and talk to Nigel I mean.\n"," Oh well we ee sort of wih went and spoke to Nigel once before 'n' he sort of um put onto one of his uh um accountants that works for him sorta thing.\n"," Okay.\n"," But yeah no I'll I will do that then.\n"," Yeah look sm smart fella smart company and uh he could give you some suggestions but uh I mean sit down and work it out for yourself I mean you you sound like a smart fella to me work the numbers and theh see what wha the best bet.\n"," Yeah cool not a problem.\n"," Cheers.\n"," Thanks Paul.\n"," Thank you see ya.\n"," Okay Irene Mossie Park g'day Irene.\n"," Uh good a good morning.\n"," Hi Irene.\n"," Hello.\n"," Yes Irene what can we do for you.\n"," Okay um I live in Mosman Park but my daughter is looking to buy a property in Cannington and I have absolutely no idea how to work out the prices this ih this is a vacant lot of four-hundred-'n'-ninety-eight square metres um adjoining recreation reserve on river frontage and they want three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand . Um because there's no history there of the h of a house being there 'n' it being sold previously how do you tell whether three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand is a reasonable price.\n"," Yeah good question that's a really tough one my my first instinct is that's a lotta money . A five-hundred square metre block in Cannington a vacant block you'd probably buy like a an ordinary one for about one-fifty one-sixty maybe  a a a v a vacant block of that size  but if it's like at a premium location there aren't many blocks like it available down on the riverside there you may well get more. Three-fifty sounds like a lotta money to me.\n"," Yeah  that's what I that was my first instinct.\n"," Yeah the the only way to uh really compare is to find some some other riverside lots like  maybe over at Wilson or depends on wuh y'know somewhere nearby  um very challenging to price something where there's nuh no other comparables and pretty much what the developers have gone is well this is unique  I'm gunna price it up at whatever I like 'n' 'n' y'know whoever if they wanna live there they'll they'll pay for it . To me it sounds like a lotta money.\n"," Okay. Okay thank you.\n"," Thanks Irene.\n"," Bye.\n"," Okay Irene thank you very much indeed uh who's next might be Susie at Herne Hill g'day Susie.\n"," Hi.\n"," Good morning Susie.\n"," Hi um I've just been given some um information about some blocks at Jurien Bay. They're house blocks and there's no time to build on 'em. What would be um like if I was to buy one and sell it without building on it would that be worth it.\n"," It depends on whether you can make a profit on it or not.\n"," Yeah I mean that's what I mean uh what's the aerh y'know is that area like uh I mean it's miles away y'know.\n"," Yeah it is Jurien's certainly moving though. There is a a few land subdivisions opening up there in anticipation of the that inner coastal road opening up 'n' when that does that's gunna make it more uh attractive to Perth people. I mean  it's closer than than um than Busselton-Dunsborough and every bit as attractive if you like the beach 'n' have been fishing 'n' that. Um and prices are are a loh are a lot cheaper I guess but uh y'know look whether or not you'd make a profit immediately will depend on how much land's available and what the demand is Susie just be careful  do some research and don't jump in in too much of a hurry okay.\n"," Okay then.\n"," Good luck.\n"," Thank you  Susie.\n"," Bye.\n"," Bye seventeen to eight.\n","\n","\n"," Thirteen minutes to eight and uh plenty of calls on the board still Roger of Padbury g'day Rog.\n"," Yeah morning Harvey 'n' Craig.\n"," Good morning Roger.\n"," Um   I've got a suh scenario Craig um where   um I've been transferred down uh to a country area and uh I'm living in the house my house at the moment which I nearly own. And uh I've got a a residential uh another residential property which I owe very little on and a commercial property which is positively geared. Now I've just bought another property uh in the um in the country area which I have to live in so there's no tax deduction for me there um I'm just wondering y'know sorta where do I go from here I've got approximate borrowings of five-sixty and approximate values of eight-ninety-six.\n"," Okay so what you're asking me is there uh room for you to luh invest some more property or is or is that what you.\n"," Yeah yeah basically um yeah what sort of what what sort of uh area can I go into now where I can hopefully y'know get some sorta tax deduction 'cos I'm just gunna beh be paying uh too much tax probably on my rents 'n' that.\n"," Alright well first thing about paying paying tax is it's great because number one it means you're breathing 'n' number two it means you're making a profit  so don't be too worried about it and there are laws for anyone anyone can use them to lower their tax so um first thing is to sit down and figure out where you're at now figure out where you wanna be in ten years from now and then work backwards 'n' if then follow a plan. One thing I've been teaching uh everyone at the seminar um I'm doing this weekend is make a plan. Alright sounds like you got the beginning of like yeah you know you wanna y'know look after yourself in the future but create a strong plan Roger 'n' then start working forward from there. It's a matter of finding out what it is you want what's right for you you got a couple of residential properties you got one commercial one and yeah look clearly figure out uh what kinda property fits in your portfolio and then go and buy some. Um do some great research make a plan and um make a good purchase so nothing wrong with that get my books I mean mm   really inexpensive go into or call our office on one-three-hundred-one-three-two-nine-four-one or any good bookstore and that'll give you some idea where to aim so make a plan is the is the most important thing I I could say to you Roger and then be confident you can go ahead.\n"," Okay. Alright thanks Craig.\n"," Thanks  for calling.\n"," Okay to Carine Wayne hello Wayne.\n"," Yeah good morning gentlemen.\n"," Hi Wayne.\n"," Um just a query on what do you think about Carine I just look at the surrounding uh suburbs like Marmian and North Beach seem to be flying ahead um Karrinyup's being rezoned 'n' y'know making lots of money 'n' Carine seems to be like the sleepy little suburb in the middle that's sorta just plodding away plodding away. Um do you see it going up much in the future or s just plugging away as it has been for the last say fifteen years or so.\n"," Well Carine tt I dunno why it really has as you say just plugged along  um look at uh Gwelup on the other side of it  um that's really come along with all the new homes that were built there uh and I mean the the price at Gwelup is around three-hundred-'n'-forty-thousand as of March but it's three-seventy as December so Gwelup's nice. Carine's looking around about the four-hundred-thousand sort of median price uh as as of March but uh North Beach and Marmian are more than a hundred-thousand more than that. So Carine by comparison looks like pretty good value to me. I think uh uh y'know it's not bad buying there  um have you got property there already.\n"," Yeah I own a property here I've h had it here for about seventeen years but  um y'know it's that it's the wh whether you sell or not 'n' move on y'know if you sell it it's gunna go isn't it  if you don't ih it won't sort of thing.\n"," Yeah look the last five years uh Carine's improved by nine-point-six per cent per year so  if you look at that versus all the areas around it it really has underperformed uh I don't know why . Um I don't think that'll stay that way forever myself.\n"," No.\n"," Uh I I think Carine's got all the all the I wants it's close to everything you wanna be close to and I think that uh you'll probably see in the next three to five years a lot of uh extended building going on there. Now what I mean by that is renovations happening 'n' people adding uh adding rooms to the large blocks that are there . And yeah you'll find that the suburb will start improving so y'know look if unless you can find uh another area that you think'll perform better why would you sell why would you sell 'n' pay any tax 'n' pay all those transfer fees 'n' if you're happy there stick around.\n"," Yeah that's right okay then thanks for that mate.\n"," Thanks.\n"," Good on you thank you bye.\n"," See you later Wayne hello Betty of Mullaloo.\n"," Hello Craig and Harvey.\n"," Hi  Betty.\n"," I've just would like your opinion please I've been looking around for three by two by twos. I have sold my home 'n' so I have about three-hundred-'n'-twenty-thousand to spend on an on a three by two by two   I've looked in Innaloo um uh Nollamara Morley all those areas around there and I've been stuck on the best designer and the best unit I can see is in Nollamara South Nollamara   where they're doing lots of new units and new two-storey homes. Is it a good idea I'm going to be putting in an offer in today perhaps to hold the unit for myself. It's not quite finished until October but the builders and the uh owners want between three-twenty-five 'n' three-thirty-five for the it's a duplex arrangement a three by two by two  a lovely design.\n"," Is it single-storey Betty.\n"," Yeah single-storey.\n"," Alright and uh a large home.\n"," Yes lounge room and family room in this yi it's a duplex but it's got a lounge room and a family room and love lots of cupboards and a lovely design.\n"," Alright now the median price in Nollamara as at March was two-fifty-three uh with a bullet that's really jumping up there  I think there's still room to go. Uh if you look at uh 'n' like Yokine it's three-fifty median price.\n"," I can't find  anything that's nice around  three-twenty.\n"," See Yokine's nearly a hundred-thousand more and  you're talking about inverted commas South Nollamara I guess that's the that's that's the better part of Nollamara if if you could say that  and that's on the Yokine border so uh by comparison that looks like reasonable value. Um so look I I can't see any any challenge why you shouldn't make that offer if it's within your budget how how how much have you looked around Betty.\n"," I have been searching I've been going through these concrete slabs on the ground and  half-walls and asking for them to send me the plans and seeing there's no cupboards and there's y'know things are wrong with all the units.\n"," Alright but this one's singing to you.\n"," This one's lovely .\n"," Theh then this is the one that that's for you  I think.\n"," Thank you cr uh  Craig I was  hoping  you would say that.\n"," Betty it sounds okay.\n"," Good on you.\n"," Thank you bye-bye.\n"," It's seven minutes to eight uh good morning now.\n","\n","\n"," Running outta time Craig four minutes to eight o'clock time though to talk to Laurie at Cooloongup g'day Laurie.\n"," Yeah good morning.\n"," Morning Laurie.\n"," Juh uh wanna get a bit of an idea of what the property around um Cooloongup or East Waikiki or something like that they call it   uh four by one double garage plenty of parking rumpus room all that just get a bit of an idea.\n"," Okay very hard for me to give you an exact number without seeing your home um  I can tell you that the the Cooloongup median price that's the middle range price which you'd think'd be like a three by one uh was a hundred-'n'-eighty-thousand as at uh the end of March and in uh Waikiki it was two-hundred-'n'-fifteen-thousand now that's uh you'd think that'd be a three by one so if it's a four by one and it's a great place and it's in good condition Laurie you'd certainly be over two-hundred-thousand but how much I don't know. Um have you had uh any local real estate agents give you an appraisal yet.\n"," Ah y get plenty of informuh plenty of pamphlets in the letterbox.\n"," Yeah stacks of 'em . Look it wouldn't hurt to invite one or two of the the I guess the more well-known ones to come 'n' give you a written appraisal. Are you actually thinking of selling or just trying to figure out what it's worth.\n"," Ah just get a bit of an idea I'm at a bit of a dilemma at the moment um uh so I just have to uh hang fire  but  there's no harm in getting some info.\n"," Yeah looh I I'm guessing and I really I'm not sure without y'know get a local specialist in there but uh but probably at least two-hundred maybe two-twenty-thousand somewhere in that range but uh g get some local help Laurie uh 'n' that that's your best bet.\n"," Thanks Laurie quickly Gail uh just uh purchased a second investment home six months old unfinished. They've borrowed the full amount plus enough to add a patio. \n"," That's a good question there's so many m mixes 'n' matches with that one.\n"," Well why don't I print this out and uh you can have a look at it during the week 'cos it is an all day question isn't it.\n"," Yeah it it uh f I need to understand what happened there I don't know whether they're living in it or not living in it um ih if you're living in it doesn't make any difference because you can't claim any depreciation benefits. Um look print that one out Harv 'n'  'n' I'll take that one under advisement.\n"," Okay now just before we go wanted to talk to you about an article wuh was it Wednesday's paper about  big redevelopment at the old Swan brewery site.\n"," Harvey Perth is growing up um wuh there's a a proposal for two like sixty-storey towers that they'll be two tallest buildings in Perth uh with about a thousand apartments in total  being built on this on this site that's been empty for like the last twenty or thirty years I th I think pretty much. Uh and uh finally a developer has got approvals from all the relative bodies to build these two amazing big towers and I think that's gunna be a watershed for for the city and um I hope that um they get plenty of buyers and uh uh people decide that um that's a good thing to be in uh myself I'm not sure about it but uh.\n"," What do you reckon they'll sell for  pretty hard to tell now isn't it.\n"," Look I'd be surprised if they start out at under three-hundred-thousand  and probably y'know upwards of y'know million plus for the for the top-storey apartments probably even even more than that for the  for the penthouses uh y'know I haven't seen the configuration yet so.\n"," Thousand apartments.\n"," Uh yeah that's huge  that that's a lot of volume I dunno how they're gunna do it but good luck to them.\n"," Alright well we'll watch that one with a great deal of interest. Mate thanks to everyone who called us today had a lotta calls  and uh sorry if you tried to get through 'n' you couldn't quite manage it but uh try again next week that's when we'll be back with Real Estate between seven and eight you have a lovely week Craig and I will talk to you at seven o'clock next Saturday morning.\n"," Thanks very much and luh look looking forward to it.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COME3-plain.txt:\n","\n"," The doctor is in the lines are open one-three-one-eight-seven-three Two G B dot com click on the Dr Graham feedback icon and   we'll attempt to uh answer as many emails as we can and get through as many calls as we possibly can good morning Doc.\n"," Good morning Luke how are ya.\n"," Not too bad.\n"," That's good. Beautiful day I thought we were gonna get some rain yesterday but it didn't happen. We need it badly don't we. Really badly. Oh goodness gracious me. What sort of a week have you had.\n"," I've had a very relaxing week cos I had a few days off.\n"," Ah.\n"," Went up to the Gold Coast and just did nothing for a week it was beautiful weather.\n"," Ah\n"," Except when that wind comes up about two o'clock in the afternoon it rips up there doesn't it.\n"," It really does I've gotta fly to the coast tomorrow very quickly and be back Monday night but uh got some work to do up there but gee whizz   it's a beautiful spot there's no doubt about that isn't it.\n"," Now there's a wu wonderful activity happening out at Kellyville today we m did mention this earlier. It's the House   of Hearts   house that's up for auction.  It uh proceeds go to the children's hospital at Westmead now this whole house the building the landscaping the pool everything   has been donated   and so it's a hundred percent profit going to the hospital uh their cardiology unit. They've got doctors there that are operating on little kids' hearts as big as a twenty cent piece it's just .\n"," And you should sy see the size of the doctors' hands. They're huge and how they do it I don't know.\n"," So we'll cross back out to the auction and find out how much they got after eleven.\n"," You know something even more amazing than being able to operate on people's hearts like that   is knowing in advance of going in there exactly what's going on. And the ultras the ultrasound techniques that they've got to ultrasound children's hearts at the moment   is unbelievable.\n"," Absolutely. All also we've got um uh All Things Medical and Men today.\n"," All things male and medical at quarter to twelve today. Very interesting one today uh at wuh uwh it's centred around the diseases that have a common symptom erectile dysfunction. Should be very interesting we're interviewing a doctor from Perth Dr Dennis Cherry   who's the director of the medic uh the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Should be very interesting.\n"," Well also with Mother's Day being uh tomorrow it's a good time to look at osteoporosis and vitamin D. We're gonna talk to Dr Toomie from James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital   about exactly that very shortly.\n"," Are we. Good that should be really good.\n"," It will indeed so ih uh it's lots happening here today on Your Health with Doc Graham 'n' Luke Bona here at Two G B. Julie good morning.\n"," Good morning.\n"," Morning Julie Dr Graham speaking.\n"," Oh how do you do um.\n"," I'm well.\n"," I'm glad uh.\n"," I'm glad too.\n"," What about phlebitis\n"," What about it.\n"," Yeah what about it. I think I've got it.\n"," Okay.\n"," I'm uh ih and uh you know the advice is keep your leg up.\n"," Yes.\n"," And I said well you know it really is very difficult to be walking around with your leg in the air.\n"," It's not easy is it.\n"," I mean you could could put a flag on it 'n' something or other but it really is it's difficult.\n"," Well let's talk about what it is first of all.  It's an inflammation or an infection of the veins of your leg.\n"," No infection.\n"," Um  probably a low grade infection I would've thought.\n"," Oh really.\n"," Yep. How old are you.\n"," seventy-eight.\n"," Don't sound seventy-eight  good for you . Have you got any varicose veins.\n"," Uh one up the top of the the I've had both hips replaced.  And uh this I have to tell you occurred after I broke my ankle.  Which was about four years ago.  And um the cast that they put on was  too tight . And the after a week m and my toes turned blue and looked like blue sausages  um uh the cast went from the toes to the uh knee   and uh I had it it had to be cut off because I just couldn't stand it.  And then they put another one on.  And for ten weeks I had the other one on  I reckoned it was still too tight and I ended up with two D V Ts.\n"," Oh goodness gracious me.  W the the bottom line out of all of that whether it's the cast whether it's the brah when wi.\n"," Started from.\n"," Whether it's the cast whether it's the broken ankle or whether it's the clot   is that the venous return to your heart has  been interfered with . The other common reason   is varicose veins . Now what happens is you do get a low grade infection or or inflammation in those veins and it's very difficult to avoid getting it. The person who told you to elevate your leg is absolutely correct and as you quite rightly point out it's very di  time. Have you got any telephone books underneath the foot of you bed.\n"," No.\n"," That's number one.  Now the reason you put them underneath the foot of your bed  is to raise the foot of your bed and to help the venous drainage. Now  that at least prevents the veins from becoming congested for about eight or nine hours a day and that's a great start.  If you don't they're congested when you get up and you don't give them a chance to get better that's the first thing.\n"," Well I used to put my legs against the wall at night.  before I go to sleep.\n"," But elevating the foot of the bed is the first thing. Number two to improve the circulation somewhat it is often wise to take some soluble aspirin if you are not on a blood thinning agent. Number three often   when they do get acutely inflamed they are infected and you may need some antibiotics. So there we are simple common sense things elevate the foot of your bed two telephone books soluble aspirin and occasionally antibiotics.\n","\n","\n"," Val good morning.\n"," Good morning Doctor.\n"," How are you?\n"," Oh pretty good.\n"," That's good.\n"," Um I I do have trouble though um most nights  cramps in the legs . Um sometimes it'll happen two or three times in the one night and the only relief I get is to get up and walk around.  Um during the day just walking around the house I don't have any problem  but if I want to do a serious walk  I do develop cramps in the calves . But the the night cramps can be .\n"," Night time cramps are the awful aren't they they're terrible.\n"," Yeah they are. It could be and and they're in various parts sometimes it's just the big toe  sometimes it's the underneath the arch uh sometimes in the calves um I did consult my G P who suggested uh I should have my electrolytes checked . Uh and he did a full blood test  but everything was  in normal limits.\n"," Yep. We don't really know what causes cramps we've we used to say it was salt depletion but I don't really think that it is. We know they're very common number one in the elderly number and I guess you're not as young as you used to be none of us are. Uh number two in those people who've got varicose veins. The treatment is relatively simple . And it's good old fashioned quinine. It's been around for a long time quinine  um and it's n what they put in tonic water so I'm not saying that you have a gin and tonic before you got to bed wha wha I know Luke would like to have a gin 'n'  um way to go  but what I am saying is ask your G P whether a little bit of quinine mightn't help the problem.\n"," Well I did suggest that to him  and he actually hadn't heard of it but somebody else had told me you know just drinking tonic water.\n"," Not you can't get enough quinine you've gotta drink about twenty gallons of tonic water.  So that's not good for a number of other reasons you won't get any sleep for another reason if you did that.\n"," Right . The the the quinine I take it is um prescribed is it.\n"," Uh yes it is . And it's called Biquinate and you you get it uh from the chemist on prescription.\n"," Right.\n"," Okay.\n"," Okay thanks very .\n"," It works all the time. Thanks Val.\n"," Okay bye.\n"," Bye now.\n"," Thank you for your call it's a quarter past ten this is Two G B. It's Mother's Day tomorrow and uh a good time to look at osteoporosis looking after our bones and vitamin D. We'll do that in just a moment.\n","\n","\n"," minutes past and Mother's Day tomorrow.\n"," Indeed Mother's Day tomorrow and by definition our mothers are older than all of us and as ladies get old they amount of calcium in their bones starts to get less and less and less. On the line to talk to us about osteoporosis is Dr Jan Toomie from the James Lance medics Medicines Research Unit. Jan good morning.\n"," Good morning how are you.\n"," Well thanks how are you.\n"," Good thank you.\n"," What is osteoporosis.\n"," Well osteoporosis is simply Latin for holes in your bones.\n"," Right.\n"," And what it means is that usually as we age um the the normal holes in the bones which we all have otherwise we'd be too heavy to stand up   get bigger and bigger and bigger and the bone gradually just becomes weaker and that predisposes us to fractures with minor trauma.\n"," Now as we get older that happens normally doesn't it.\n"," It does um and unfortunately what people think is is normal is also actually uh you know brings them to be at risk of fractures.\n"," So is ih by definition of the of the fact that we are getting older do we all get osteoporosis.\n"," We don't all get osteoporosis because the the definition of osteoporosis is a certain degree of bone loss. We all lose bone as we age though.\n"," Right now we we know that it's quite common in women or we seem to think that you know it's a matter of course in women. Do men get osteoporosis as well.\n"," They do certainly do um not as much as as women but it's a a major unrecognised health problem in men.\n"," Doctor why is it worse with women sorry l Luke here.\n"," Um because women start off with uh less calcium in their bones to begin with you know they've got smaller lighter bones to begin with   so they can't afford to lose as much bone as men.\n"," Jan I would have said that women are always more trouble than men anyway but I wasn't allowed to say that on air.\n"," High mai high maintenance is what you were actually about to say wasn't it.\n"," High maintenance is exactly right.  What do we do Jan about people who have osteoporosis.\n"," Well the first thing we need to do is make sure that their their calcium level their calcium intake is adequate . And um that they're getting enough exercise.\n"," 'N' that's important that exercise is very important isn't it.\n"," That's right because exercise actually strengthens the bone . Um but we know that that's not enough in people who already um have osteoporosis. Um they need to cut down on the amount of coffee they drink because caffeine unfortunately is bad for your bones . Uh they should stop smoking if there aren't enough reasons to stop already . And they need to cut down their alcohol intake . Um and then if if they actually have osteoporosis then there are very good treatments uh available.\n"," What  what is the principle of treatment of osteoporosis.\n"," The the principle is to slow down the rate of bone loss. There are there are two types of cells in the bone and and one type builds up the bone and the other type breaks it down  and basically you want to change the balance because when you have osteoporosis the cells that are breaking it down are working faster than the cells that are building it up.\n"," What about vitamin supplements.\n"," Um vitamin D is a useful supplement um people used to think that in Australia because we get lots of sunlight  and listeners might know that most of our vitamin D is is made uh with exposure to sunlight . Um people used to think that it just wasn't an issue in Australia  but um there've been some very interesting studies which show that there're quite a significant number of Australians despite how sunny actually do have sub-optimal vitamin D levels   and the reason that we need vitamin D is that vitamin D is the thing that tells us to absorb calcium.\n"," Okay   we're talking with Dr Jan taoh uh Toomie who is from the James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital we're talking about osteoporosis with Mother's Day tomorrow it's a timely reminder to uh look after our bones. Dr Jan there's a caller online from Bankstown that wants to ask you a question can you take it.\n"," Sure.\n"," Okay Anne from Bankstown Dr Jan Toomie.\n"," Yes Doctor I'm eighty-eight and I've had o osteoporosis with the fractures for years  not knowing anything about it. I think it would be wise to talk to younger women   I uh over the years after I was uh near menstruation time I used to feel that the top of m oh the bottom part of my body didn't want to hold up the top . Then I had fractures or fracture in the lumbar area didn't know what it was just thought oh that's a terrible sharp pain   and then later on got some up further in the back. Now I've shrunk about six or seven inches   and in pain all the time I take Evista and Actonel  to prevent more fractures but life is a misery  because you're never out of pain the back burns like it's on fire I can feel cold but my back is always very hot . Is there anything else I could do I don't suppose so because.\n"," Well um unfortunately no I mean what what you've found is that once the fractures have occurred   you can't undo that . Um all you can do is try to prevent more fractures and and what you're taking is is uh just y'know it's the right thing to take . Um but you're quite right about addressing the problem with younger women to try to stop the fractures occurring in the first place.\n"," Yes  well I didn't know anybody with it I didn't  know the symptoms or anything about it.\n"," Well well one of the unfortunate things is that often uh there are no symptoms until you have a fracture. Just bone loss itself doesn't cause any pain. Um and so it it's something that the whole community really needs to be aware of as as a risk for all of us as we get older.\n"," Jan it's a really common complaint isn't it osteop.\n"," It is it's very common.\n"," And uh one thing we need to stress too is that the treatment is not immediate and I you know  it takes a long time to even slow the process down doesn't it.\n"," It does yes you certainly can't sort of take one pill and think well that's good I've fixed it.\n"," All over. Jan thank you very much for your time it is important and it's relevant with Mother's Day upon us tomorrow   be aware of osteoporosis.\n"," Yep and the Mother's Day tomorrow good time to start thinking about that. Dr Jan nice to talk to you.\n"," And to you thank you.\n"," Dr Jan Toomie from the James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales it's twenty-five past ten Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," We'll take a break and we'll come back uh by the way your cue to call to go into the draw for the trip   for two to China includes airfares  to Beijing  four nights accommodation.\n"," Isn't there something about a yum cha brunch.\n"," Yes. Are you gunna come back for that on the Sunday.\n"," Might.\n"," Dude for a free feed I'm sure you will.\n"," Oh don't be like that I just like Chinese.\n"," It'll be Sunday the sixteenth of May we'll have a Chinese yum cha brunch thanks to the Golden Century restaurant here at Two G B. Your cue to call coming up between now and twelve but you must stay listening.\n","\n","\n"," to calls here   on your Your Health with Doc Graham.\n"," Merilyn good morning. Merilyn good morning.\n"," Good morning Dr Graham. Uh I was going to phone you a couple of weeks ago. I've had a hernia operation going on.\n"," What sort of a hernia hiatus hernia  or inguinal hernia.\n"," The one near the navel.\n"," Umbilical hernia.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Right.\n"," I had a had my gall bladder out twelve months ago and I had a got an infection after it and after having the infection operation I got the hernia . But what I'm um concerned about this morning is that um well I've had a lot of heartburn very  severe heartburn . I take Zoton  twice a day and that's  what doesn't hold it when I'm having a bad day   I have to drink milk . Um and I'm having funny bowel motions the day before yesterday I had to race to the toilet  and it was semi solid and and yellow . It was yellow and then this morning at four o'clock I was on the toilet   and I just had to sit and let it work it's way through . But um got very severe  stomach and abdomuh  abdominal pains and I'm just hoping it's a bug.\n"," That sounds exactly  what it is just because you've had a hernia operation uh any sort of operation gall bladder operation hernia operation   doesn't mean that you can't get other things wrong with you and you still do you still get tonsillitis you still  get appendicitis and you can still get gastroenteritis which sounds like what you've got.\n","\n","[C4 Nah  and because of the operation that's stirring the my tummy up.\n"," No. You would have the cramps whether you had the operation or not.\n"," Oh right yes.\n"," It is due directly to the fact that you you've got some diarrhoea . And whatever's causing the diarrhoea is causing the cramps. It's not related I would think to the hernia operation or the gall bladder operation  or the infection . It would it may be   if you didn't have the diarrhoea and it's always a relief to me as a medical practitioner when somebody comes in and they say I've got this funny pain in my tummy and I say you had any diarrhoea and they say oh yeah I haven't been able to get off the toilet for a week 'n' I say well beauty  theh y'know that that that to me means that is more likely than not going to be the cause of your of your problem.\n"," Yeah well it's  not actual diarrhoea it'd be a one off.\n"," Change in bowel habit no  no no that's fine . Wouldn't be too concerned about that and I'm sure it hasn't got anything to do with the hernia operation.\n"," It's ten thirty-one time for news headlines.\n","\n","\n"," You're listening to Your Health with Doc Graham it's twenty-three to eleven.\n"," Tom good morning.\n"," Oh good morning Dr Graham. Uh it's Tom here as you know.\n"," Yes Tom.\n"," Uh look I wa I'd like to talk to you about uh postrate  um problems . Now I'm eighty-one years of age . Uh I don't get up through the night I'm very lucky there . Last examination was the postrate  was quite normal  but  my last blood test  my um P S A had doubled.\n"," To what.\n"," Oh now I that I don't know  but what I was wondering what is the next procedure if your P S A is up which I don't know what the level would be  before you have to have something else done and then I'd like to know what that is.\n"," Okay. L let's talk about P S As for one second. A P S A is a specific blood test which tells us the s the about your prostate. It doesn't tell us what's in your prostate but it does give us some indication of the size of your prostate . The P S A is elevated in people who have got cancer of the prostate. The P S A is elevated in people who have big prostates. And the P S A is elevated in people who have infected prostates. So it's a non-specific test. The most important thing that I said in all of that was   people who've got cancer of the prostate have elevated P S As. Now if you've got a normal size prostate and an elevated P S A or a rising P S A if you were one of my patients I think that should be looked at.\n"," I see.\n"," What I would sugge well if you were one of my patients what I would suggest to you is that you should go and see   a urologist and he would do an ultrasound guided biopsy of your prostate . In other words he would use an ultrasound to determine exactly the size of your prostate and he would stick a needle in your prostate and look at the tissue that he withdrew underneath the microscope . Now that is not terribly difficult procedure although it's not terribly comfortable it's not all that uncomfortable either and it gives us some idea a good idea really w of whether you have a nasty cancer growing in your or a cancer growing in your prostate.\n"," I see.\n"," Now that's the thing that we've gotta be concerned about. Whether or not the elevation in your P S A means that you have a prostatic malignancy. And I would really sugge I'd go back to your G P and have a chat  to him and say to him do you think that it's worthwhile going to see somebody about this.\n"," I see and they take what do they take a biopsy then do they.\n"," M he would send you to a urologist  and I think he would take a biopsy yes.\n"," Good. And and what about infection problems like um ih is is that minimum. Like.\n"," After the biopsy as a result of the biopsy.\n"," Yes.\n"," Um it's possible to get an infection after you've had a biopsy done yes. But not having the biopsy done because you're frightened that you might get an infection is not reasonable . Because if you've got a cancer of the prostate there you want to know about it and the sooner you get it uh looked at the better   and believe me if I had to have a malignancy I would prefer to have a prostatic malignancy than just about anything else. Please go and speak to your G P and ask him whether he thinks that you mightn't be w better off going to see a specialist.\n","\n","\n"," Claire good morning.\n"," Oh good morning Dr Graham and Luke. Um I don't have a problem myself Doctor but last week you had a grandmother speaking about her eight year old grandson.\n"," Yes who  he he w he didn't seem to have the eye hand co-ordination.\n"," Um.\n"," Couldn't ride a bike.\n"," one thing wasn't it.\n"," Beg your pardon.\n"," Well I I didn't hear all of that last week but when I came in on it it was he he had p very poor co-ordination.\n"," That's right  he he couldn't  ride a push bike they'd done everything.\n"," That's right now he's just so similar to my gra eight eight year old grandson . My daughter um a friend recommended gymnastics . She has him in which he is improving he has been going to that for about six months now  and also another thing   that I'd like to share what that lady may be able to do um is take him to a occupational therapist . Now that's where my grandson goes once a week she takes him out of school the occupational therapist said it's theh they have hypermobility.\n"," Hypermobility.\n"," Hypermobility yes the and the m the muscles are too flexible . Now my grandson had the same problem. He played soccer he couldn't at really play. He would skip along the soccer field  and we used to think what's the matter with him you know he played he didn't play football he does swimming he still learns swimming  he doesn't like putting his head in the water  like that lady's little grandson . And I thought that .\n"," I uh I know a couple of adults who're in that boat too.\n"," Pardon.\n"," I know a couple of adults who're in that boat too . No names no pack drill but my wife might be listening she gunna kill me when you get home.\n"," Yes and also it's uh I don't know about that lady's grandson but it's affected my grandson's writing ha ha he has poor writing . Um but they're working on it.\n"," Claire Claire that  isn't exactly the same that is not quite the same sort of story that that other lady had because there are other symptoms especially the writing. The writing would concern me . And I would make sure that he has his hearing assessed  uh and that he possibly goes and sees a um paediatrician   because although that other lady ch last week said the only thing that that child couldn't do was ride a push bike.\n"," Oh did she as I said I didn't quite I I wasn't in on it from the beginning.\n"," No uh  the only thing that the only thing that he couldn't do was ride a push bike. You've got a few your grandson has a few more symptoms   and I would definitely make sure that his hearing's okay and d and question whether he doesn't need a referral to a paediatrician.\n"," Thanks for your call Claire.\n"," Alright thank you Doctor bye.\n"," Bye now . Eighteen to eleven o'clock Two G B.\n"," Julie good morning.\n"," Good morning Dr Graham. Um I just wanted to ask you   I always seem to be inundated with sebaceous cysts . Uh are they a result of uncleanliness or dirtiness or.\n"," Not really um you probably have an oily skin and they are just really blocked sweat glands they're like big pimples and they're really a nuisance they're awful things.\n"," I know they're horrible.\n"," And they c do they get infected Julie.\n"," Quite often yes.\n"," How old are you.\n"," Oh me uh I'm fifty-two.\n"," Have you been checked for sugar.\n"," Uh I uh well a while ago yeah.\n"," Has anybody in your family got diabetes.\n"," No we haven't actually.\n"," Are you.\n"," I did I did I had   a test and for about a couple of months they thought I may have been I may have had diabetes but then it proved to be negative.\n"," Did you have the two hour sugar test the glucose tolerance test.\n"," No no they just took a blood test.\n"," Mm Julie I I would go back to your G P and and there there're a couple of issues here. Number one you you probably have an oily skin and they are blocked sweat glands so they're the sebaceous cysts. Number  two. They can get infected and it is not uncommon once you have one infected to get a whole crop of them infected as the result of the infection itself. But number three you really should make sure that you haven't got diabetes have you any children.\n"," No I don't I'm single no children.\n"," Okay and your mother or your father didn't have diabetes.\n"," No no.\n"," Okay. It's worth while getting that checked out again. The the gold standard to determine whether you have diabetes or not is a thing called a glucose tolerance test. It's a two hour test and they take about four lots of sh uh blood from you and from that you can tell absolutely whether you have diabetes or not so here we are   sebaceous cysts can be quite normal recurrent infections may be because of the infection that doesn't quite go away but be careful that haven't got an underlying problem diabetes which is the cause of the whole lot.\n"," And your chance to win a trip for two to China coming up soon between now and midday today stay listening for your cue to call.\n"," Amy good morning.\n"," Hello.\n"," Hello Amy.\n"," Yes Dr Graham good morning.\n"," Good mor.\n"," Uh I had a question to the doctor the uh about osteoporosis . I missed out . I would like your advice please. Under my uh nephrologist uh instruction   I am not allowed to take any vitamin D no calcium nor vitamins C because I have got calculus history   my kidney . At the same time I have been on the Fosamax since four years now   but I'm on the Prednisone for my uh polymyalgia and Warfarin because on account of my mechanical valve . So I'm sort of you know I don't know what to do.\n"," Okay Amy I don't think I'd do anything other than what you're doing at the moment . Now there's no doubt that the Prednisone causes ost well makes the osteoporosis far more pronounced far quick far more quickly . But the Fosamax on the other hand should to a degree counterbalance that . One of the things that really was said was that the treatment for osteoporosis is not quick. It is a long term treatment . And you don't get magic cures it takes months and months and months and years  to see whether the medication that you're taking is doing any good . But you are at risk. From the sound of your voice you're   well you won't see sixty-five again. Um would that be correct.\n"," Yes.\n"," And you're on the Prednisone which is not helping your osteoporosis but  the Fosamax will counteract it so it's like a seesaw if you like. Um the Prednisone on one side  the Fosamax on the other side which one's going to be heavier which one's going to win . And I don't know the answer to that question but I they are on opposite sides of the seesaw they're certainly not on same side but I wouldn't change anything I'd be going exac along exactly the same way as you have been and wait and see what happens.\n","\n","\n"," Maureen good morning.\n"," Good morning Dr Graham.\n"," Yes.\n"," Um I was wondering uh if you could give me some information on P M R.\n"," Polymyalgia rheumatica.\n"," That's it.\n"," Okay. We just talking about that.\n"," Yeah I was diagnosed um about fourteen months ago with it . Um I've been on Prednisone . Um when I f was first diagnosed it was twenty-three . Um I went down. I.\n"," This is the dose of Prednisone you're talking about.\n"," No my blood test was .\n"," Oh ye yeah so right.\n"," Twenty-three . Um I got it down to six-point-seven  so I started cutting down on the Prednisone . It went up to twenty-eight . I went back up on the Prednisone.\n"," You didn't need the blood test to tell you that it wasn't good did you.\n"," No. Um it came down again to three-point-six. I cut down to one and half. The last three weeks I've been in absolute agony . Um I rang my doc this morning 'cos I had a blood test last week it's back up to twenty-three.\n"," Right okay. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an auto immune disease. That means your body decides that it wants to attack itself   and attacks your muscles and your joints. I must confess that I have been fooled by polymyalgia rheumatica uh on three or four occasions   it has just an unusual presentation. It can present as aching joints it can present as aching muscles it can present as aching knees. One thing about it in its acute phase it is you are sick. When  you have polymyalgia rheumatica you look sick you feel sick you feel absolutely miserable . I think probably the hardest part about polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosing it   and I've certainly missed it and I make no bones about it I've missed it on a number of occasions because it isn't something that you think about. The diagnosis is usually made by well in my case anyway by a uh rheumatologist who I've sent people to . And the treatment is to reduce the inflammation   we don't know what makes the polymyalgia rheumatica start we don't know what makes it stop we don't know what makes it better we don't know what makes it worse but what we do know is that if you go onto Prednisone in significant doses you feel a lot better. Now I'm not a big fan of Prednisone never have been. It can.\n"," That's why I tried to cut down because I know the side effects from it myself and that.\n"," That's right . But it can save your life . And under these circumstances uh it ih you really haven't got a lot of choice.\n"," There's nothing else you can  do for it.\n"," There is nothing else that you can do for it but you do need to be under the care of a competent rheumatologist and I get the feeling and I'm just saying th I just get the impression   that those people who stay on the Prednisone a little bit longer than they should in the first instance in other words if your numbers go down to three and you feel okay and you immediately immediately go off the Prednisone uh the polymyalgia rheumatica tends to bounce back. Sometimes if you can stay on it just a little bit longer it is my impression and I say my impression I have no figures or nothing other than just a a a a G P's nose to back it up that those people don't seem to get the recurrence as quickly. But uh you do need to be under the care of a competent um rheumatologist.\n","\n","\n"," Marilyn good morning.\n"," Oh good morning Dr Graham. Um it sounds like it's all women's problems this morning .  Um I've my problem is .\n"," We have we've got Matters 'n' Male 'n' Medical coming up so we'll balance the equation a bit later on.\n"," Okay um my problem is uh I went off H R T in January and I took the you know I went through the doctor you know downsizing it and everything   then was off it for a couple of months and then the hot flushes and the sweats all came back again  and everything so I've chosen to go back on it again  so I don't know and I had been off it once before and when I took it again it more or less kicks in straight away  so I get rid of the hot flushes. Well I've it's uh pro uh it's probably only been a week but I'm still getting you know it hasn't doesn't feel any different. I'm just wondering how long does it take before the H R T .\n"," Almost immediately is normally the answer to that question provided you're taking enough of it. Which H R T are you taking.\n"," Uh it's um  it's the  it no it's the the tablets the ravera .\n"," Premarin and Provera.\n"," Yes yes  at six-point-two-five . And uh five milligrams.\n"," Yep. You may have to increase the Premarin a l the uh Premarin a little bit but   go and see your G P. The uh Marilyn the only thing that I do say to you is   this is an informed consent decision. You realise that there is an increased incidence of breast cancer an increased incidence of uterine cancer. Make sure you have your breasts checked regularly make sure you have regular pap smears. Because it is an informed consent decision but normally it kicks in pretty well straight away it may be that you need a little bit more oestrogen.\n","\n","\n"," Welcome back to Your Health with Doc Graham the lines are open on one-three-one-eight-seven-three Two G B dot com is where you'll find us on the net but can we can please   yeeeh you've got to keep your emails brief Doc haven't you d um don't tell us a short story just give us it quickly because it's very very hard to write through and and wade through it all so if you can be as as brief as you can that'd be great. All m uh m Matters Male and Medical coming up in about uh fif ooh twenty-five minutes.\n"," About twenty-five minutes yes. Um and it very interesting uh we're gunna have a talk today with Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Um brought to us by uh Lilly Pharmaceuticals. And it really is talking about a lot of diseases that have one common symptom. Chris are you there good morning.\n"," Yes yeah hi Doctor hi Luke how youse doing.\n"," Good thank you how are you.\n"," Yeah good thank you. Look I've actually um I think you answered some of my problems or some of my questions with the last calls . I've been o on Prednisone since October last year um for an on un undiagnosed muscle problem which  which they s seem to have um y y'know problems diagnosing and I'm just worried about long term effects 'cos everyone tells me   that that it gives you cataracts that it gives you osteo  that that it causes cancer and .\n"," Prednisone is a wonderful drug Chris but it must be used m absolutely totally and completely properly. It can save your life but it can also kill you and therein lies its paradox. Um who dy who couldn't diagnose what was wrong with your muscles.\n"," Okay um uh m uh it's my G P sent me to a rheumatologist.\n"," Yes.\n"," Um and she ee he he was sending me for all tests and I went for a lotta tests like um you know bone scans and X rays and wha.\n"," And did he say the magic words polymyalgia rheumatica or not.\n"," No he he didn't he said I was too young for it like I'm I'm I I'm I'm only forty . And I'm pi and he said to the to that he's never heard of it in in that age um but what it is it actually started in ih ih in my thigh muscles and sorta spread up to my shoulders . And um and the last few days I I've been trying to cut back ih some Prednisone I actually halved the dosage myself and I can feel coming back into my shoulders  and and without it I've um I'm like I really do have trouble functioning. I get so stiff and .\n"," Chris if you ca a Prednisone can be believe it or not addictive too. It was marketed in the original cuh case as an anti depressant because anybody on Prednisone feels really good   and then they go off it and they feel really bad. Prednisone does a couple of things to you. Number one it can increase your chances of osteoporosis. Number two   it can g it prevents your body from fighting infection. Number three it can put up your blood pressure. Number four it can give you liver changes it can do all sorts of things . But it can save your life. What I suggest you do is this. I suggest you go back and see the specialist and you say to him Doctor have you got a diagnosis for me   do you think it is wise for me to stay on Prednisone for the next I don't know how long   um because if you haven't got a diagnosis for me then what the hell am I taking the Prednisone for. And take it from there. But  it can cure you it can save your life but it can also kill you so be careful okay.\n"," Okay great thanks a lot there.\n"," Bye Chris.\n"," Bye-bye.\n","\n","\n"," Margaret good morning.\n"," Oh good morning Dr Graham and Luke. Doctor uh two years ago I had severe pancreatitis.\n"," Right.\n"," Uh and.\n"," That's a really really that and renal colic are the two worst pains that you can have.\n"," Yes. Well I uh ended up I had the an abscess on the pancreas  and I lost half my pancreas  and then they had to um do a bypass . In now at that stage I was sick quite a lot and couldn't keep anything down for months  and had bile  so last night I was sick again and it didn't come on till about half past twelve which was about six or seven hours  after I'd eaten  and it was only bile that I was bringing up.\n"," Okay. How long ago did you have the pancreatitis and the operation.\n"," The la well the operation was six years ago  but I the last attack I had was two years ago.\n"," Right and you've been absolutely pain free since then.\n"," For that yes.\n"," Okay.\n"," I actually stopped the vomiting about five o'clock this morning because I suffer with Meniere's . And I had some um Stemetil suppositories that  I took to stop the vomiting this  morning.\n"," Margaret I think you've gotta approach this from a common sense point of view. Your concern is that it might be the pancreatitis coming back.\n"," Yes.\n"," And c the common things occur commonly. Now just because you've had pancreatitis and an operation on your pancreas and a bypass   doesn't mean that you can get a l number of other things that cause you to feel sick. The best guide is do you feel or did you feel last night like you felt two or three years ago when you had this problem before. And I guess if you really thought about it the answer is no   because from the sounds of things this morning it's settling down. What I would suggest that you do is in the f common sense basic principles. Don't go and gorge yourself over the weekend. Take small meals and often and try and stick to the clear fluids over the weekend a little and often . If the vomiting is still there on Monday morning it certainly is worth a trip back to your G P. But my my guess is that over the weekend if you just have uh Bonox or chicken broth or.\n"," I can't have Bonox because it's two high in salt for the Meniere's.\n"," Right that's fair enough um then what else can I think of just some chicken broth or my mum used to make a great chicken soup with a little bit of rice in it and just  the broth off that with a little bit of rice   nothing fatty nothing greasy and little and often so if you had   a cup of a cup of chicken broth and drank it over a half an hour and then a couple of hours later another one and then a couple of hours later another one   rather than sit down to meat and three veg and some gravy   and if you're still uh vomiting on Monday I'd be going straight back to your G P but my gut feeling is that common things occur commonly and it's probably just a passing viral .\n","\n","\n"," Fourteen past eleven.\n"," Anne good morning.\n"," Good morning Dr Graham and Luke. Uh Dr Graham   my mother's just been put on the last three months uh I hope I pronounce it correctly for you the injection D E C A.\n"," Deca Durabolin.\n"," Yes  and Caltrate  the tablets . Mum's had uh breaks in both of her arms  and broken ribs . Now what I'd like to ask you is yesterday mum had her third injection . Now our G P you can't sort of discuss things with him I don't know why but that's how things have been the last few months . I tried to ask him yesterday how long mum will be on the injections . And as I said I couldn't get anything out of him would you be kind enough 'cos mum has naturally osteoporosis . I was wondering if you would be k so kind 'n' explain to me does mum stay on the injection plus the Caltrate for life or is it only a set period of time.\n"," Anne can I ask you who put her on it.\n"," The uh the G P.\n"," The G P.\n"," Yes.\n"," Okay. Deca Durabolin is a hormone injection. It is designed it's called Nandrolone and it's really quite an unusual hormone it is designed to put calcium back into the bones. But does suffer from a lot of the complications that uh other hormones do in that it does put your blood pressure up and a few things like that . It is however very effective ih in putting calcium back into the bones. My feeling is that she's probably going to be on that for the rest of her life. How often is she having the injections.\n"," Uh the once every month. The  eighth of each month.\n"," The eighth of each month. I would think that she's probably going to be on it more or less for the rest of her life however what I would suggest she do is ask her G P if she could get a referral to an endocrinologist who specialises in osteoporosis . There are so many ways of treating people with osteoporosis that I believe it's always wise for somebody to hold have a guiding influence over that and as a G P yes I I can initiate treatment for osteoporosis but I'm often more comfortable if somebody who sees a lot of osteoporosis uh has a hand in the treatment even if it's just to say yes Dr Graham you're going okay I don't want to change anything.\n"," May I ask uh one question should you have regular blood tests with anything like this Dr Graham.\n"," I look I'm a great believer in doing r le regular blood tests on on everybody 'n' by regular it means different things to different people   but for example I like to get everybody in my patients' cholesterol checked every six to twelve months depending on whether it's been up   evr especially if they've got high blood pressure at least once a year I like to get their kidneys checked out and if they're diabetics I like to get their what's called haemoglobin A one C checked at least twice a year. So yes it's worthwhile getting regular blood tests done   it's even more worthwhile if you're on something like Deca Durabolin.\n","\n","\n"," Yes you're listening to the doc   Doc Graham. Until midday today then the Continuous Call Team Andrew Moore heading up th the uh the team this uh this weekend. We'll take a break this is Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," Michael good morning.\n"," Oh hi there good morning Doctor. Uh Doctor I got uh just a question if I may uh I sneeze like heck when I when I change temperatures like if I get from the cold and go into a car with the heater on  I sneeze uh uh um a real lot and that's the same as though if I get outta the shower and I don't dry myself real a warm shower and don't dry myself real quickly I sneeze again like that or if I I go out of a warm house outside without a lotta coats on I sneeze like heck again .\n"," Has this been happening has this been happening all the time Michael or it is just something new.\n"," Oh no it's been happening for a while. Few years I s'pose.\n"," Okay uh  excuse me your nose is the reason you sneeze is you get an irritation in the mucous membrane of your nose . Now you can sneeze wuh in the Spring and the Autumn because of hay fever which is pollen actually irritating your nose . But fairly obviously you've got a sensitive nose  and the change in temperature is irritating your nose . Now I don't think that there's anything that you can do about it but equally  I don't think it's ih all that serious either.\n"," Nah.\n"," If it did become serious   you could reduce the sensitivity of the mucous membrane of your nose   by taking one of the over the counter antihistamines that are readily available such as Claritin or Telfast and  they do tend to reduce the sensitivity of the mucous membrane. The  other thing that your doctor could do if it really became a problem   would be to give you a nose spray a cortisone-based nose spray. That  that also reduces the sensitivity. Be  careful. Do not be temperted  to take stuff like Sinex which has got pseudoephedrine in it and you can become addicted to it . Not serious. Don't worry about it and the only reason you'd do something about it if it really causes you some trouble and there are a number of treatment options available.\n"," Yeah no it doesn't cause any major problems you know it doesn't it doesn't turn into the flu or anything . I've had the flu needle and that so.\n"," No that's fine don't worry about it okay. Thanks Michael.\n","\n","\n"," Cathy good morning.\n"," Hi good morning Dr Graham. I've just found out that I'm pregnant . And um.\n"," Congrat con congratulations.\n"," Oh thank you so much.\n"," First one second one.\n"," Number two.\n"," Number two and what've you got at home.\n"," I've got a boy three .\n"," A boy three.\n"," Yes.\n"," You know I have been known over the years to to be part owners in in race horses  and I have a um a a boy a girl and a boy   and I hope this one's a girl for you  because I reckon that's a king's wish  and if I ever get to name a race horse again it'll be king's wish.\n"," King's wish. Why don't we send her some flowers.\n"," Gee that'd be great.\n"," We'll s we'll send you can we send you some flowers before you even start.\n",".\n"," Fresh flowers dot com dot A U. Okay when you're finished with dr Graham we'll put you back in the waiting room and uh Daisy'll look after you okay.\n"," Oh thank you.\n"," Now tell me what can I do to help.\n"," What I've had um last year I had this really unbelievable virus  um that left me sort of wuh I've been told sort of like with chronic fatigue.\n"," Yes.\n"," But I've been fighting it off naturally.\n"," Right well  yes you're gunna get fatigued now  with this pregnancy.\n"," I know what so what can I do I don't I didn't wanna leave it too long so I've just persevered and my blood count's fine but my E S R's always high.  And I've seen a professor and everything.\n"," This is prior to falling pregnant.\n"," No this is just last week so would that attribute. She thinks it's a non-specific test and so   she doesn't know   if it's because of the pregnancy also but it's like forty-nine.\n"," That is a little bit high yes.\n"," Do you think.\n"," It's a little bit high okay. Which part of the world do you live in Cathy.\n"," Um si I live in Maroubra.\n"," Right.\n"," Yeah and   also I've got really bad neck and jaw pain from the virus.\n"," Okay let's take this in two parts.\n"," Yeah.\n"," The mai how far pregnant are you how many weeks.\n"," I I'm only six weeks.\n"," Right so you're only just pregnant.\n"," Yeah.\n"," The first thing you need to d and did have you had any miscarriages.\n"," No.\n"," So you had one live child this is the second time you've been pregnant.\n"," Yes.\n"," Okay. The first thing you need to do is ensure a successful outcome for this pregnancy.\n"," Yes.\n"," So irrespective of what else is going on in your life you've got sore arms you've got sore legs you've got a sore back you've got sore something or other  the first priority is this pregnancy . Therefore you need to go and see a competent obstetrician  and say look I've got an elevated E S R  uh uh nobody's quite sure of the significance of it but  I am pregnant and I want a successful outcome to this pregnancy . So everything else takes second place at this point in time  to the pregnancy . And irrespective of what the reason for the elevated E S R is as long as that baby's growing well  and growing healthily and is normal  then everything else can be put on hold until after the pregnancy . So don't try and look for multiple answers  just concentrate on one thing  and that is the successful outcome of this pregnancy.\n"," Um once you spoke about a j a person with jaw pain and and I think you send them off to  a specialist or.\n"," They had T M J arthritis but Cathy.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Theh just just hang on half a tick. Let me just say it again . Because this is really important to get this message through . The the area that you should be concentrating on  is the bit between the knees and the navel . That's the baby . We're not gunna concentrate on our jaw if it's sore then we have might have to take some panadol or some disprin for it  but everything else goes on hold and I mean everything  until this baby is delivered successfully . Now yes you might have a sore jaw yes you might have a sore toe yes you might have a headache but it's all secondary  to the progress of this pregnancy . If you can sit back and say this pregnancy's going along alright and I can't find a reason for having a sore toe or a sore knee or a sore neck I'll just take something symptomatically that's not gunna hurt the baby and we'll worry about it after this baby's born.\n"," Okay theh good advice there I think Cathy.\n"," Okay thank you.\n"," Stay right there s 'cos I wanna send you some flowers  w when are you  when are you due.\n"," Um January five.\n"," Oh it's a while  to go  it's only six weeks.\n"," So that means thirty uh  thirty-four weeks to go.\n"," Do do you want the flowers now or when you when you have the baby.\n"," No give them to her now  don't be mean.\n"," I'll   stay there Daisy will get your details Cathy 'n' there's the advice from the doc I could I could sense that you don't have a dog and bark as well coming on there but.\n","\n","[E1 No no no  we haven't done that today.\n"," Haven't had one yet today but I can feel one coming on.\n"," No well only if it's appropriate.\n"," Only if it's appropriate.\n"," Yes.\n"," Alright then.\n","\n","\n"," Your chance to go into the draw for a trip to China coming up very soon also Matters Male and Medical we'll be talking with Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Is that correct.\n"," That's indeed correct.\n"," Okay and uh if you have any male problems that you would like to discuss we'll give you plenty of opportunity between quarter to and midday.\n"," We're gunna keep Dr Cherry on the line and he may well be able to an help us el answer these questions. Uh Brian good morning.\n"," Oh good morning Doctor. Um  run wide and stepped in the side. What can you.\n"," Wide and step inside.\n"," What can you tell me about Laetrile there's a mate of mine uh who's uh riddled with cancer over there in Western Australia . And he won't have his chemo he says no that's not on he's had a lash at that but he's uh uh having um these infusions  of Laetrile what do you n what can you tell me about it.\n"," Not a lot Brian. Laetrile's been around for a long time and it certainly doesn't form part of the mainstream treatment for cancer . It's supposed to have come from almonds or something like that.\n"," Uh the uh the kernels of the apricot.\n"," Apricots I'm sorry it was apricots  I apologise. Um and interestingly enough uh it's it's been around for about forty years  but um the composition of the Laetrile now is not the same as the composition of the Laetrile some years ago . Um it certainly doesn't form part of the mainstream treatment but I'll tell you one thing about somebody who's got an incurable disease. You never take away hope . Under any circumstances  you don't take away hope . And that's the most important thing which you can do. If he thinks that it's working it's it's working. He's opted not for mains t not to take mainstream treatment  support him. That's the only thing that you can do.\n"," Good on you mate.\n"," See you Brian.\n"," Thanks.\n","\n","\n"," Earlier this morning we were talking about the House of Hearts which was up for auction today um proceeds going to uh Westmead Children's Hospital.\n"," Yes indeed 'n' what was the result do we know.\n"," Well Gilly Paxton is one of the organisers she's there now Gilly good morning.\n"," Good morning again how are you.\n"," Well we're very very well well. The auction was at just after eleven o'clock was did it start on time.\n"," Yes we did we started pretty much on time but unfortunately the house didn't sell this morning it didn't meet its reserve and so it's going to go up for sale um on Monday and so anybody who's missed out hasn't been able to have a look at it um you still have a great chance to buy this wonderful house. But for the hospital um it was very exciting because Landcom and the minister actually gave us a cheque for half a million dollars pending  the sale of the house  such good news yes.\n"," Isn't that good.\n"," So it was a wonderful morning for us um a and obviously for the lucky person who's eventually going to live in this splendid house um so   maybe good for them it didn't sell too.\n"," It didn't sell what's ih what is the reserve.\n"," Oh I don't I don't think I I duh I'm not sure if I'm allowed to tell you that so so I probably shouldn't.\n"," Oh okay . Uh it didn't meet the reserve so  Mark Moraza was thinking it would get six-hundred to six-fifty. It didn't make the reserve yeah well ob you you can't tell us what the reserve is so um we can only guess it's gunna go for sale for the sale now .\n"," The the the vendor's bid was five-eighty so that probably gives um people an idea of where they were looking um .\n"," Five-eight wm ma I think Mark was probably on the money six-hundred  to six-fifty.\n"," I'd say  he was on the money.\n"," Probably was yeah.\n"," Alright listen thank you for that I'm sorry it didn't sell um because that means the Westmead Children's Hospital misses out but they they will eventually get something.\n"," Absolutely and as I say we did we did actually get a cheque for half a million dollars today from Landcom  um you know sort of ahead of the sale so we're very fortunate and the kids are very fortunate um and it's just been the best project.\n"," Alright Gilly thanks for that keep us informed will you.\n"," Thank you will do  bye-bye.\n"," Gilly Paxton oh there you go didn't sell but.\n"," Oh it's a funny market at the minute.\n"," It is indeed.  It is indeed. It we'll take a break it's nineteen to twelve Two G B.\n"," Luke thanks again once again to our sponsors Lilly Pharmaceuticals we're in a position to bring to the attention of our listeners   the importance of one common symptom. It's possibly the clue that they need to recognise that they might be at risk of an underlying disease process. The symptom that all these disease processes have in common is erectile dysfunction. No-one talks about this problem   yet it's estimated that about thirty-nine percent of males   between the age of forty and sixty-nine have got erectile dysfunction and of those twelve percent have complete erectile dysfunction. Yet this is a problem that always happens to somebody else. Well it's my intention as best I can   to encourage any of my listeners who've got this problem to discuss it with their G Ps. On the line to tell us about what else might be wrong if you've got elecrectile  dysfunction   is Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre Dennis good morning.\n"," Good morning Graham.\n"," How are you.\n"," I'm very well and yourself.\n"," Very well thank you. Uh Dennis could you tell us a little bit about the Human Sexuality Centre.\n"," Well it's a s uh centre that we have here in Perth uh which looks at both male and female sexual dysfunction across a broad spectrum of uh sexual disorders running from   what you've just spoken abou that is erectile dysfunction   along with uh disorders of ejaculation premature ejaculation that is coming too quickly or even retarded or delayed or absent ejaculation   uh through to loss of libido through to uh transgender p dysphoria uh even aspects of uh gay sexuality  and uh that is across the full spectrum of even philias uh paraphilic behaviours and fetishes and those sorts of things.\n"," All sorts of things.\n"," Yes.\n"," Uh Dennis if there're any of our listeners out there whose neighbour's got erectile dysfunction they haven't got it themselves. Uh their neighbour's got it. What else might they be at risk of.\n"," Well w what you have to remember of course is that the penis is nothing more than a glorified blood vessel . And as a consequence of that any of the disorders that affect blood vessels will affect the penis . And hence if you look at the issues that are associated for example   uh diabetes heart disease peripheral vascular disease hypertension disorders of\n","cholesterol excess cigarette smoking and of course a lack of exercise and uh central truncal obesity. And now we're getting down to the lifestyle issues  which affect the blood vessels  and tha and that becomes extremely important.\n"," Okay heart disease  are you sy are you saying that somebody who has erectile dysfunction might have heart disease.\n"," And also the corollary that is vice versa. Anybody that's got heart disease will have a h strong probability that they're going to have erectile dysfunction   and in fact there are now increasing evidence in the literature that those men that have erectile dysfunction   it's a lead in to the fact that there's a strong probability that they may have uh sub-clinical or non s asymptomatic heart disease. So either or   should make you wake up and sit up and take notice and think mm perhaps I ought to be   much more aware of what's going in inside my body. If you think that the coronary arteries are about the same size as the cavernosal arteries which are the tiny arteries that lead into the penis . And if you accept the fact that there's a probability that what happens throughout the body is fairly equal then you can see that there is good reason to believe that if it's happening to the cavernosal or the coronary arteries then the opposite is almost certainly to be true.\n"," Tell us about syndrome X.\n"," Well syndrome X is also called the metabolic syndrome and it's and I'm glad you brought that up 'cos it brings into the issue those lifestyle factors that are affecting uh our community in large numbers.\n"," Right.\n"," It's perhaps has it's beginning in fact way back in the womb and there's some interesting work being done f for a condition for a condition called FOAD F O A D which is foetal onset of adult disease.\n"," What what what is syndrome X though ih ih.\n"," Syndrome X is is um ih is where you um have ih obesity truncal obesity you have insulin resistance you have glucose intolerance and you have hypertension and those issues uh stem from a metabolic abnormality   which then leads you into getting vascular disease.\n"," It's almost like Homer Simpson this heart the Homer Simpson look I guess.\n"," That's uh in fact almost down to a nutshell because what Homer's got is the male pattern baldness and he's got that central obesity   and the interesting thing about syndrome X is that with this central truncal obesity you get a lot of conversion of the male hormone testosterone across to oestradiol and so you get alteration in the male's pattern of hormone flux and as a consequence of that it also leads into this other condition that we won't talk about now but mention and that is the male what's so-called the male andropause so there's a linkage right across the spectrum of disorders that are affecting men of our age.\n"," And   people with s people who uh have erectile dysfunction may well have syndrome X as well.\n"," It's oh almost well almost certainly there can be other causes for erectile dysfunction neurogenic  but more than uh more than most likely that will be the case Graham.\n"," Okay now n nobody wants to talk about this so but we're going to talk about it. If you've got erectile dysfunction how can it be treated.\n"," Well very successfully today I mean m most men are are and their partners in fact perhaps even more so the latter are aware of the fact that uh we have now got some very good treatments in the oral what we call the oral P D E fives. That as a group they consist of Viagra Cialis and Levitra. These are wonderful compounds that in fact affect the whole vascular system. Uh they work on improving the biochemical processes that lead to relaxation of blood vessels and lead to the relaxation of the erectile tissue and thereby help and promote erections.\n"," So it's it's not all over you're not six foot under and dead if you if you've uh if you've got erectile dysfunction and as a result you you find that you've got heart disease there's lots of things that we can do.\n"," Oh my word in fact uh y'know you can revitalise your life as long as you use this as a uh uh as a an essential warning which says oops looks like things aren't going too well I've gotta get myself back in   uh take stock of things and get myself back into uh order.\n"," Dennis we're gunna have to go for a break would you mind holding on for a moment and we're gunna ask any of our listeners out there   if they've got a problem they might be concerned and they might .\n"," Or if they have a neighbour.\n"," Or if they've g sorry they they haven't got it themselves then that's right  it's their neighbour that's got the problem .\n"," Or a friend.\n"," Okay. Let's.\n"," I'm delighted to be here.\n"," Let's um let's ask one of our listeners who's never ever ever discussed this before in the an anonymity of the radio  to ring in and talk to us  because it just might save their life.\n"," And certainly m save a relationship it's eleven minutes to twelve   one-three-one-eight-seven-three if you'd like to talk to Dr Dennis Cherry and Dr Graham about this   very very sensitive issue and if you've been uh uh uh uh a little bit hesitant to talk about it   now is the time. It can be completely anonymous you can ring up for your neighbour if you like one-three-one-   eight-seven-three it's eleven to twelve.\n","\n","\n"," It's eight minutes to twelve the Continuous Call Team headed by Andrew Moore this afternoon   after twelve o'clock today one-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number Dr Dennis Cherry is joining us the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre and uh Dr Graham and uh we'll take a call and I think we have Errol on line Errol gm good morning.\n"," Hi.\n"," G'day Errol.\n"," I'm in me mid seventies.\n"," Right\n"," Uh I had a T U R on my prostate   about eleven years ago.\n"," Right.\n"," And I found out then that it didn't work afterwards.\n"," Right . What didn't w what didn't work the T U R or.\n"," get an erection . Couldn't substain  it you know . The urge is still there today even probably ten times as strong . Uh I have three stents in my heart and one in my aorta . Uh I have vascular problems in my leg.\n"," Right. Have you got  an have you got angina still.\n"," Yes I'm still being treated for angina yeah.\n"," Right. Dennis what can we say to Errol.\n"," Can I take any of these pills.\n"," Uh w well if he's got angina and if he's using nitrates that's the little things you slip under the tongue or the spray that you use then it would be prohibited to use the new pills that's uh Viagra Cialis and Levitra  because they interact badly to cause a quite a significant drop in blood pressure or they can do and  you won't know when that would be  so that would be out of the question.\n"," I've tried the needles and things   I've had the dopular  x-rays and things scans . And they say the blood comes in and goes out the other end just as quick.\n"," Yes.\n"," Right.\n"," tablets stop that.\n"," No d uh the problem you have is now what they venous incompetence that is  the erectile tissue is so damaged it can't lock off and  lock out.\n"," Almost like a varicose vein down there isn't it.\n"," That's right yeah and it's a bit like a hydraulic pump that the valve mechanism is now just so badly damaged it can't respond.\n"," So I g I've got no hope.\n"," Well the uh the the only one hope you've got is either the possibility of vacuum erection devices and or a penile implant and at your age I think uh and vascular disease  be few surgeons that would want to look at you.\n"," It would  it would be very very difficult one. Errol I think unfortunately  this is one of the situations where the options are very very very limited the only thing that I can suggest to you however is go to your cardiologist  and say to him Doctor I I've got this problem there is tablets that are available but am I able to take them and ask him exactly will you fall into the category that you can or can't take these tablets.\n"," Errol thanks for your call Pamela good morning.\n"," Pamela yes good morning Pamela.\n"," Yes good morning Doctor.\n"," Good morning.\n"," How are you.\n"," I'm well thanks how are you. You got two doctors to talk to you today.\n"," Aren't I lucky.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Well I'm ringing on behalf of my husband 'n' he's not here at the moment.\n"," Right.\n"," Uh he's sixty years of age  and uh   uh he's uh .\n"," Pamela  just just hang on one sec. Look number one it's very brave of you to ring because it's obviously a difficult thing for you to do.\n"," It is.\n"," Number two   this precisely why we k having this segment because nobody damn well wants to talk about it. And it's a problem not only for the men   it can be a problem for the women too.\n"," Oh yes of course I do realise that.\n"," So let's get it just pretend that there's nobody else and there isn't anybody else there's you and myself and Dr Cherry so just spit it out.\n"," Alright yes um   he's been there's been difficulty in getting an erection for the we've been married twenty years for for eighteen years now . Uh he is on Warfarin . He's got very bad vascular veins he has has had a couple of ulcers on the veins as well but  that's been cleared.\n"," Right they're probably venous ulcers right.\n"," Yes he's had uh uh the lump uh but the then the theh then he was put on Warfarin about eight nine years ago . But before before that he's always had a problem with an erection his   his testicles are very small  and uh I just um. He  finds it difficult to talk about but because .\n"," Absolutely most men do find it very difficult to talk about it.\n"," And and I am just you know just yearning.\n"," At your wits yeah at your wits end Dennis what advice would you give Pamela.\n"," Well certainly he needs a very thorough investigation there if if the comment she made about the small testicles is true we know that men who have poor testosterone production have a very ih testosterone's extremely important in maintaining the health of the erectile tissue . So without that he would certainly be going downhill. Second thing  is that if he's got venous disease   uh and it's venous vascular disease then there may well be some arterial component as well . So he needs a very he needs to see I mean the point you made Graham is very true he needs to see a doctor he needs to be worked up thoroughly  uh and as a consequence of that a real proper assessment made as to why he hasn't got erectile dysfunction I I wouldn't be surprised by now that there's a rather intense psychogenic component.\n"," M tt so uh it's like a dog chasing it's tail it doesn't work and the more you worry about it the less it works.\n"," That's right.\n"," Pamela this is really important what Dr Cherry has said is that your husband   even if you can get him to go to the doctor just purely and simply for a check-up.\n"," Well he does see him for his I N R but we.\n"," No that's neither here nor there and you've gotta go with him and you say  why don't you tell the doctor what's going on. I heard this program on Two G B that said you might be at risk of diabetes you might be at risk of heart disease. Tell him what's going on   and maybe he can help you and really   maybe he can help both of you. Pamela look thank you very much for calling in   Dennis I'm sorry we've run out of time. I really appreciated you taking the time this morning   and it's amazing the board lit up like a christmas tree I'm telling you there's a big problem out there and that's precisely why we're doing this segment. Thanks again Dennis really  appreciate it.\n"," Bye-bye.\n"," Bye.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of ABCNE2-plain.txt:\n","\n"," And Greg Kerrin is my guest. Hello Greg.\n"," G'day Trevor how are you.\n"," Very well thank you how are you.\n"," Good I'm good thank you.\n"," You're looking very festive in a very uh well it's a Hawaiian shirt but it's red it's it's almost Christmassy isn't it.\n"," Red and white that's right it's  that time of the year isn't it.\n"," I like that yes . Yes now uh what sort of flower that's the hibiscus uh it would be have uh being a real Hawaiian shirt wouldn't it.\n"," Absolutely.\n"," Okay yes. Glad you can identify the flower that's on your shirt.\n"," I'm glad you can . Shows you're listening to the program .\n"," Not not not a great flower to try and grow in Tassie though.\n"," Uh there are a few of them growing around . In pockets in warm pockets yes absolutely. Um.\n"," What up in the north-east somewhere.\n"," No my word no no not uh in Hobart they're growing very well . They'll grow on the east coast but they'll grow in Hobart as well uh there are a few of them around Newtown  uh a few around Lenah Valley so you do  see them around.\n"," Okay  alright but the  but prefer but prefer a warmer climate.\n"," They would prefer a warm climate yes  but uh in a sun trap they're a great little plant to grow.\n"," Alright well thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number at this time of the year people taking breaks getting out and about and plenty of time to get out in the garden so I wouldn't be surprised if we have quite a few questions from our listeners this afternoon Graham from Hobart first cab off the rank how are you Graham.\n"," Fine thank you. Uh Greg do you know anything about truss tomatoes . The expensive ones  seven or eight dollars a kilo from the supermarket.\n"," Yes yes.\n"," Uh well I've got ten plants growing.\n"," Yeah.\n"," They're about ten centimetres high but the stems are very thin do I do anything with them or is that what they   they do they grow on a vine.\n"," They'll grow on a vine Graham  so look to promote the the the stem growth  and uh help them thicken up pinch the the side laterals outta them. Until they get to a reasonable height  and l then let them grow and expand uh and then they'll start fruiting.\n"," Oh very good. Uh another thing y'know the gentleman last week that couldn't get any apricots on his tree.\n"," Yeah yeah.\n"," Yes yes up at Swansea way wasn't he.\n"," No he was up in the north.\n"," I had uh I have got two tamarillo trees one   exactly the same size and planted the same day. One has massive fruit the other one didn't have any . So I fed it about four handfuls of um sulfate of potash  every week for about four or five weeks. The leaves started to turn brown on the edges so I stopped. All those leaves fell off and then the new leaves and fruit there's m masses on the tree.\n"," Good. Well that's good.\n"," So it's it's massive doses of the uh.\n"," Of the sulfate of potash.\n"," Potash.\n"," Yeah yeah  thanks Graham.\n"," No problem.\n"," Alright Graham thank you for your call Patricia from Montrose good afternoon Patricia.\n"," Uh good afternoon gentlemen um I have a passionfruit a Nelly Kelly a grafted one  that I've had for about six years. It's been struggling along. This year it's had about twenty flowers on it and all but one have dropped off. And that one has got a swelling in it that looks like a passionfruit. Y'know is is something I'm doing that I'm not getting passionfruit or what.\n"," I reckon Patricia that your passionfruit is a little bit hungry . Okay is it a little bit is it a little bit pale and yellowy in the leaves.\n"," I've cut the yucky leaves off  and I'm left with uh rather nice um um fresh green leaves.\n"," Fresh green leaves good okay  I reckon it's a little bit hungry. Now  um Nelly Kelly passionfruit are really heavy feeders and by that I mean you're going to need to feed them more than once a year you're gunna need to feed them at least two or three times a year and the best thing to use on them is either super phosphate right  or a complete fertiliser . Now if you give your Nelly Kelly passionfruit at least two or three good handfuls of that and water it in throughout the year you'll not only get lush growth and have very green leaves uh but you'll also tt get an abundance of fruit coming through.\n"," I see  so what you're saying is that the passionfruit has not been fed enough  enough to enable it to make fruit is that what you're saying.\n"," That's right because uh 'cos when you th you picture your passionfruit in your mind you've got these g really big  glossy green leaves with  lovely long leaders and tendrils. Now  it takes uh a lot of uh energy to maintain those big green leaves to begin with  and it also takes a lot of energy to grow with big green leaves . Okay  and that's why it needs a good feed  and regularly .\n"," Patricia have you got much fruit at all over the six years. Nothing at all really.\n"," None.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Okay it's just struggled all the way.\n"," My first fruit and I'm sitting down there guarding it .\n"," Bet you are day and night .\n"," Well then make sure you're the only one that enjoys  that fruit Patricia.\n"," I will don't worry about that .\n"," Good on you.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Okay.\n"," Thanks Patricia . Jeez talk about hard fruits for your labour. Uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number l lot of listeners phone in to say that they've got Nelly Kellys uh uh generally speaking Greg are they   more easy to grow in the passionfruit fam.\n"," Um it's not so much that they're easy to grow Trevor it's that they're such a great fruit . They're a lovely fruit to eat they're the definitely the pick of the passionfruits.\n"," They're one of the sweeter fruit are they.\n"," They're one of the sweeter ones but they've also one of these plants or fruiting plants has been around since the year dot. They're like a moor puhp morg puh puh muh  puh like a Moor Park apricot  or uh a Meyer lemon. They're they're proven winners they're reliable uh and people just keep coming back to them . And every so often you get a new variety that comes in and and a few people test them and they come back and they say nah it's not as good as the Nelly Kelly . You can't beat it.\n"," Alright . Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number and I should uh mention too that we're gunna offer up a copy of the the latest issue of the A B C Limelight magazine. So to our best caller this afternoon and Greg will be keeping a close ear on you uh we will offer a copy of uh the A B C's Limelight magazine some good reading over summer and indeed uh when we're looking for some decent entertainment on the radio and the box you'll find it there 'n' some good stories too. John from Newtown g'day John.\n"," Hello.\n"," Yes John hello.\n"," Oh sorry old mate I didn't realise you were so quick.\n"," Oh that's alright John.\n"," Um good afternoon to you both number one I've guh old lady across the road my dear old mate gave me some great big fat juicy bulbs the name of which I can only remember she called them naked ladies.\n"," Yeah yeah.\n"," She said that they wouldn't um flower the first year but I've  planted them out in sort of good compost and they burst out in loads and loads of green leaves but no flower  now this year will they flower.\n"," Yeah they will now uh a bulb like a naked lady likes being rather pot-bound or root-bound  and it's bound up so if you put it in the pot John  it'll probably flower next year  but if you put it in the ground it'll probably flower the year after.\n"," Gotcha  so do these ones I've I've got some in a pot which didn't flower last year  but they're I put a hell of a lot in so they must be getting pretty pushed together.\n"," Yih that's w that's what you want you want those roots to really mat down together and then it'll start to flower.\n"," So these ones should   come up with a bit of a flower this year.\n"," That's right and then around about say every ooh oh five or six years you can take to them with a spade  and and and thin them out a little bit  and then they'll start flowering again.\n"," May I ask you the proper name it always sounds a bit sort of rude to.\n"," Saying naked lady bulbs .\n"," There's nothing wrong with saying naked lady bulbs they've been aruh they're another one. They've been around for so long. People know them as naked ladies or nerines.\n"," Wuh my old prim and proper mate unfortunately of course she died lih last year  she was eighty-six and  she called her that I thought well if a lady like her can call a.\n",".\n"," Naked ladies yeah. They're called nerines  John nerines.\n"," Good man thanks for your help.\n"," Okay.\n"," Thank you John . Uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred for Gardening Talkback on Nine-Three-Six A B C Hobart Iris from Sandy Bay hello Iris.\n"," Hello. Um I wonder if you could help me with my irises both  both Dutch and flag.\n"," Yes.\n"," They won't flower um. They have all the foliage  both um the flag ones in particular have um yep beautiful big wide tall  leaves but nothing happens. I expose the rhizomes to the sun. I fertilise them.\n"," What with Iris.\n"," Um the pellet stuff.\n"," Yep.\n"," Yun in  that outdoor  stuff and uh occasionally some seeh uh uh seaweed g uh liquid  Aquasol or something and um   uh I've got about thirty and I got about three . And I didn't  get any Dutch irises.\n"," H h how long have you had the flag irises in for.\n"," A long long time.\n"," Alright well I think you're being too kind to them.\n"," Ooh.\n"," Well I didn't think I mean they grow wild in in the country don't they.\n"," That's exactly why I think you're being too kind to them. You are feeding them too much and they're sitting back there and they're very complacent they're happy 'n' they're getting fat 'n' they don't have to they don't have to  flower for you . So they're not going to.\n"," I wondered if I I should dig them up and put them in a new bed.\n"," Absolutely not no leave them where they are but don't fl uh feed them for at least another two or three years . Alright it sounds like you're over feeding them and they're they're just in a in a puchih position where they just they don't have to do anything.\n"," We are in clay.\n"," Doesn't matter.\n"," Oh well that's .\n"," Doesn't matter.\n"," In y'know as I said in the country you see them absolutely neglected 'n' they  flower beautifully.\n"," Exactly and that's exactly why we don't want you to feed them anymore.\n"," Right.\n"," And that kinda goes against the grain doesn't it because you listen to me all the time 'n' I'm saying feed it  feed it feed it but in this case don't.\n"," Starve it.\n"," Yes.\n"," Well it has this lush growth but nothing else.\n"," Yeah and that's why. You're feeding them too much . Okay now as far as your other irises go are you doing the same thing . Are you feeding them a lot.\n"," Uh wuh yes uh the whole garden geh  I d I duh don't put much sheep manure or stuff about I find that's  hard to get 'n'  uh it's easier to buy something .\n"," Okay well look for the next two years or so uh avoid feeding the iris beds  right completely and let them dry out a little bit as well.\n"," Yes well they are um and have been f kept fairly damp.\n"," Right yeah well you want them to dry out a little bit. You wanna stress them a bit because that's how you're gunna make them flower . They're one of these plants that really reacts well to stress . So the more stress you f you give them by not feeding them very often and not watering them too much the better the flowers and the prolonged flowering season.\n"," Oh I'll  just ignore them then.\n"," Yes .\n"," Mm and Iris don't you get too stressed going hard on your irises okay.\n"," Thank you very much .\n"," Thanks Iris bye-bye.\n"," Have a nice Christmas . Seventeen minutes to three.\n","\n","\n"," Trevor Jackson and Greg Kerrin this afternoon for Gardening Talkback sixteen minutes to three good afternoon Peter how are you.\n"," Good afternoon Trevor.\n"," What can we do for you Pete.\n"," Uh Greg regarding my walnut tree that I spoke to you about eighteen months ago I mentioned to your brother when he was last in I think it was week before last  I dunno when he passed on the message or not that uh you told me to take to it with a broom handle . Which I did . 'N' last year it grew about a metre . Sixteen seventeen years old by the way  and it grew about a metre still no fruit. This year has grown again and I actually have walnuts on it .\n"," There you go.\n"," Your idea of the broom handle works absolutely beautifully.\n"," There you go.\n"," So I thought I'd ring you with that one.\n"," Good.\n"," The other reason why I called was uh I think I spoke to you again last year about uh anything to keep wallabies off the off the roses and it started again this year you haven't come up with anything since the last time  we spoke apart from a bit of lead in their ear of course .\n"," Mm.\n"," Ooh that's a bit rough isn't it.\n"," Um what about what about getting some blood 'n' bone.\n"," Yeah.\n"," And putting some blood 'n' bone in a stocking.\n"," Ah.\n"," And hanging some blood 'n' bone in stockings around your roses.\n"," Okay.\n"," I do not believe they like the r the s the smell of the or the stench of rotting blood 'n' bone.\n"," Ooh I see that's worth a try. Uh.\n"," Mm. I'm not so crazy on it myself Greg but I suppose if it keeps the wallabies away .\n"," Well you could try that did I suggest to you that you try um spraying your roses with Seasol.\n"," No I do use a lotta Seasol in my gardening .\n"," Okay well there's another one. Um I I believe it works to a certain point that if you if you spray your roses with Seasol uh both possums and wallabies don't like the smell and the taste of the seaweed  okay but the only drawback is you've gotta regularly do that so you'd need to do it every mwah I'd say every week or thereabouts and ih c certainly after it's rained. But I would try that in or as a combination with the blood 'n' bone trick.\n"," I'll give that a try I tried a product last year that's uh well actually it's called Poss-Off  and that's got a chilli base I would suggest. When you're spraying it on it just about takes your breath away . But that didn't seem to work either  they they they .\n"," Kept the possums away but not the wallabies.\n"," Exactly .\n"," Well wuh uh it's a known fact that wallabies like roses with chilli.\n"," Oh absolutely yes . Uh they're of Mexican uh descent aren't they .\n"," Actually I'll just tell you a quick little one that was in the Reader's Digest this month that uh there's a a story that the bees are going on strike.\n"," Uh yes.\n"," Yes.\n"," More honey and uh what is it uh more more honey and shorter flowers .\n"," Oh okay. I like that thanks Peter have a great Christmas.\n"," thanks.\n"," Alright Leon good afternoon how are you. Hello Leon. Are you there. No we've lost Leon. Carol might like to try and get Leon back Kath hello Kath.\n"," Ah good afternoon.\n"," G'day Kath.\n"," Um last year I planted a Nelly Kelly passionfruit.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Lots of foliage lots of flowers. They all dutifully produced little babies.\n"," Mm.\n"," But they got to about the size of a large green olive they turned yellow and went soft.\n"," And there's nothing inside them.\n"," There's nothing inside them so I lost my temper with it.\n"," Mm.\n"," Cut it right back all I had left was stem I ignore that completely. I don't water it I don't feed it. It's covered in foliage it's starting to flower is it going to happen again.\n"," Yeah.\n"," So what's the what is the problem.\n"," Right well the deal with that Kath is that Nelly Kelly passionfruits are grafted  okay. Now what's happened is.\n"," Keep an eye on the um.\n"," On the suckers.\n"," On the suckers.\n"," Right but at some stage your plant has suckered and your graft has died and now all you're l you're left with is a sucker.\n"," Right the whole thing comes out  then .\n"," That's exactly right the whole things come comes out you've gotta buy yourself a new one  and then for the first twelve to eighteen months   every so often go out and just check the graft and make sure nothing's suckering from underneath and it should be fine.\n"," Oh goody I'll get one.\n"," But that's what's wrong with it unfortunately.\n"," I'll go buy a new one next week.\n"," Mm hmm okay.\n"," it'll be my Christmas present. Thank you.\n"," Good on you  Kath have a nice Christmas. Leon we've got you back hello Leon.\n"," Oh good afternoon.\n"," Yes.\n"," I want to strike some petenia cuttings . Uh uh which is the best time of the year to take those.\n"," Right now Leon.\n"," Right now.\n"," Right now because the new growth from the Spring that goes really hot fiery red in colour  has hardened off . Now now's the time of the year to take the cuttings so   what you need to do is take your cuttings from the eastern side of the bush . And the reason for that is because all the carbohydrates are in the eastern sunny side of the bush   um take the b the c cuttings around about pen or pencil thickness . And around about in old terms three inches long.\n"," Okay yep.\n"," Alright. Strip the cutting back to two leaves at the top of the cutting . And then you can eih you can try two methods you can either dip your cuttings in uh a rooting gel. Don't buy the liquid or the powder buy the gel 'cos it's it's a better product these days so the rooting gel or you can dip the cuttings in some honey.\n"," I see yep yep.\n"," Yeah both of those will stimulate um root growth on your cuttings. They'll take around about oh around about four to six months to strike. So don't expect anything to happen within the four to six months. If for one reason or another the the cuttings start to flower then cut the flowers off   right . And um I would take if I were you uh how many do you want.\n"," Oh probably uh a dozen.\n"," Alright well take about forty cuttings . Okay 'cos you'll find that if you get ten out of forty cuttings then you're doing pretty well.\n"," Yeah I just wondering see I don't think my   cuttings that I would take would be as thick as you were saying uh.\n"," Well look try and take them as thick as you possibly can.\n"," And how uh rigid h how stiff are they actually.\n"," Oh at this  well at this time of the year 'cos that new growth has hardened off  right it's reasonably stiff.\n"," So you don't want the ones that are that you can virtually bend over.\n"," If you can wrap your finger around the stem and you get a little bit of resistance   right  then then they're ready to cut . Okay if they're really s uh uh s uh well they're sitting bolt upright 'n' they're very stiff then no you can't take them . You still want a little bit of flexibility in the cutting.\n"," Good yes and uh w dampness wuh how how damp do I keep them.\n"," Uh you make sure that your your propagation mix is moist  but never saturated okay and  not too dry. It's a really difficult one. You do need to water them every day. So I'd water them religiously every morning and then if we have an exceptionally dry day then you'll need to water them again.\n"," Just with a spray over the leaves.\n"," Uh yes but you wanna keep the mix wet not the leaves.\n"," Good okay then.\n"," Alright.\n"," Yes.\n"," Okay Leon.\n"," Good thanks very much.\n"," Thank you very much for your call it is nine minutes to three thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred the number to call.\n","\n","\n"," It's Trevor Jackson with Greg Kerrin for the last time this year by by the way uh for Gardening Talkback so your last chance to have a chat to Greg before we resume the program um uh towards the end of January next year. Bill from Moonah g'day Bill.\n"," Uh guh uh uh gentlemen.\n"," G'day Bill.\n"," What can we do for you Bill.\n"," I wanna kill something.\n"," Oh.\n"," Oh . That doesn't suh. Sounds a bit nasty.\n"," nextdoor neighbour and I have joined forces uh to get rid of the ivy on our fence which is tearing the fence down. What's the best stuff to.\n"," Mm.\n"," Vhoo.\n"," Wuh we've got the ivy out alright but of course it's roots everywhere.\n"," Ivy's tough very tough.\n"," 'N' you've got a you got a coalition of uh  neighbours there Bill .\n"," They call you the ivy league .\n"," Um to kill ivy look um blackberry and tree killer  would be the best thing to use.\n"," Spray it on or paint it on.\n"," Tt uh uh have you got exposed stems. Or have you got foliage.\n"," I've got foliage galore  and also where we've been pulling it out there's it's rooted . I haven't got all the roots out.\n"," Okay um   I I would say for you the easiest thing to do would be to spray the foliage . Now please read the directions  when you purchase the blackberry tree killer and make sure that you follow all the precautions . It's most important um you will need to apply it more than once   maybe up to three or four times uh over three weeks  and that should knock the ivy back but be warned it's gunna come back again and yih it will take you probably twelve months to knock it off.\n"," Oh.\n"," So you're just gunna have to keep at it 'n' at it 'n' at it 'n' at it 'n' at it. It's one of those one of those pesty sort of weeds when it when it invades your garden to the extent that it has yours and your neighbour's you've just gotta keep at it all the time . One spray won't kill it.\n"," Okay.\n"," Alright  so just bear that in mind. But good luck that'll do it Bill.\n"," Thanks very much .\n"," Okay.\n"," Alright Bill.\n"," Thanks Bill.\n"," Okay have a great Christmas. Mm Iris. Good afternoon Iris.\n"," Hello.\n"," Yes how are things in Bridgewater this afternoon.\n"," Oh it's a bit chilly we've got a sea breeze.\n"," Oh. That's lovely uh the the the nice refreshing change to yesterday.\n"," Oh yes if only we'd get some rain.\n"," Yes.\n"," need it.\n"," It's been trying though all day.\n"," It has been. Yes my problem is I've mentioned to you before about soil wetting agents.\n"," Yes.\n"," Now when I put that on do I water my lawn first or do I just water the lawn with the the soil wetter and then put the hose on it.\n"," Are you which one are you using Iris.\n"," Well it's one that I mix in granules in a bucket 'n' then put it in a c watering can.\n"," And then water it on.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Okay. Well you don't need to water the lawn first  right. You only ih if you mixing it up with water  then just apply it   that way . Right there's no wat need to wet the lawn first because if you saturate the lawn or saturate the lawn before you you put your wetting agent down  um there's a good chance that it will flood all into one spot in the lawn  rather than getting an even distribution right across the lawn so just just use that uh uh mixture you've got in the watering can and apply it that way.\n"," And when do I water it afterwards with a sprinkler.\n"," No.\n"," No okay.\n"," No let it soak in Iris  and then tomorrow or the day after you can start watering again but you're gunna find that it will reduce your uh watering by about oh   three or four quarters.\n"," Oh that'll be lovely.\n"," Okay.\n"," Mm.\n"," Oh okay.\n"," Okay thank you very much.\n"," Alright Iris thank you very much for your call . And uh Greg uh who're we gunna pick as our winner this afternoon who should it be.\n"," Um well look I think Iris from Sandy Bay with her irises  that was just   a good question.\n"," Alright and just tickled your fancy just a little bit.\n"," Absolutely.\n"," Greg Kerrin uh from uh Carol and myself a big thankyou for your involvement in the program this year all of your uh participation and uh look forward to having you back next year you will come back won't you.\n"," I'll be back.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COME4-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Morning Mark.\n","\n"," Uh uh good morning John. Um the yeah I've I've been listening to you for thirty-two years and that must make me sound old but   but it doesn't but in all of that time in all of that thirty-two years you've done some pretty tough stories but I don't ever remember anything as bad as this Russian thing.\n"," I don't either.\n"," Where where people go out and and um kill babies and children for for for what they think is a   is a is a just cause   and w and we we call them terrorists   but they don't terrorise me they they revolt me they they just revolt me. Uh th I ju we ju they're cowards. They're most the most gutless bums I've I've ever heard of to   to shoot a shoot a a little kiddie in the m in the back. I mean y you you l look at what makes a coward in Australia a coward in Australia is somebody who gunna king hit you in a pub or waits till you turn around and hits you over the back of the head or s or something. But these these people these people that we call terrorists   they go and tie somebody up wi with their hands behind them in Iraq or something and then chop their head off on on video  and and they and they say that that's that's right. Uh uh they say they're executing they're not executing anybody execution is is something that's done by a court they're they're just murdering cold blood murder.\n"," That's what it is.\n"," And th these l little kids have are exactly the same thing as if they were tied up filmed and and had their heads chopped off because these people get some   gratification out of it. We're what're what're we doing John.\n"," I don't know. I don't know Mark I sat most of the weekend glued to it looking at it seeing too much of the same footage over and over again I've gotta say but nonetheless   it was uh it was just an awful weekend for us but uh I was think about it this morning while I was taking a shower   uh we were worried in Sydney last night because uh there was a hail storm.  Uh we were worried probably 'cos there was a traffic jam.  The hail held up the traffic but the hail was nothing like the hail of bullets   that uh those little kids experienced in the back of their legs back of their little heads   uh beautiful little skin just ripped apart by bullets  and all in the name of uh religion or politics tase take your pick.\n"," Well th wu you y'know you say religion you've s you've said this many times you say it's not all Muslims. I know but when was the last time you saw or heard a Muslim doing a good brave deed for the whole world community.\n"," Well I'd I can't tell you that but of course that would happen because there are many good Muslims. It's just this fanatical   uh branch of uh of Islam that are simply murderers.  And they do it all in the name   of uh of their god and they have this extraordinary belief that they're gunna be off to some wonderful heaven   uh to be able to  rest in peace after the destruction of humanity in the way that they've destroyed it.\n"," But then we've we blame the political leaders we're blaming Putin now for for for the Russian soldiers not being able to.\n"," Well I w  I d  I d I don't know about that I'm not b uh blaming Putin the whole the whole thing was a disaster who in the world could have predicted that such a thing would happen.\n"," Well why do you need to have your army to have plans drawn up to rescue schoolchildren from schools I mean come on we we we  people aren't meant to take over them.\n"," Yeah but but in fairness Mark nobody in their right mind nobody in their right mind could have anticipated that that sort of thing would happen   any more than anybody in their right mind could have anticipated September eleven unless you had some uh intelligence on the subject and the same with what occurred   in in Russia. I couldn't ever have imagined in my wildest dreams of any human being wanting to do that to other human beings.\n","\n","\n"," Well as um   as Mark just said Russian president Vladimir Putin has now admitted the security forces' response was inadequate and ill prepared and promised all sorts as yet unspecified new security measures   but is this uh uh is this part of the international terrorist attack or is this specifically a Russian issue relating to the independence of Chechnya. Clive Williams is an international terrorism expert with the Strategic and Defence Study Centre at the A N U   and he's um on the line Clive good morning.\n"," Good morning John.\n"," Is this specifically about uh Chechnya or is it part of the international terrorist attack on  Christianity.\n"," Ih it's mainly about Chechnya. The the Russians actually first occupied Chechnya in eighteen-fifty-eight and they've maintained fairly tight control over Chechnya ever since apart from a couple of periods um after the October Revolution in I think it was nineteen-seventeen uh they lost control of Chechnya and it gained some degree of independence and uh uh under Stalin he deported most of the Chechen population to the Soviet far eastern Siberia and they were allowed to return under Krushchev but   y'know there have been periods when Russian control has been relatively weak and other times when it's been stronger but um certainly since probably ninety-four uh they've had trouble controlling Chechnya. And there are some outside elements fighting in Chechnya in support of the Chechens.\n"," Alright now there the the Chechen independence movement is that uh entirely Muslim.\n"," Uh I'd I'd I'd say so yes because um I mean it's a predominantly Islamic population there probably are pockets of Christian groups within Chechnya but I think there'd be very small numbers. It's predominantly an Islamic country as is Ingushetia which is a neighbouring   country in Dagestan but um North Ossetia is actually predominantly Christian so it is a bit different to the others.\n"," Uh di  support from the Christian Chechen population.\n"," Um maybe uh I I I don't know I mean I s I'd say that if there are Christians in Chechnya they'd be a f in a a very small minority of people there I would think. I don't think uh you know they're a factor in all of this.\n"," So this ih this is about the independence of Chechnya not about creating an Islamic state.\n"," Well th th a the aim is create an independent Islamic state so it's two elements there and because of the fact of the population being predominantly Muslim   uh they do get outside support so y'know there has been money flowing in to support the Chechen resistance movement if you want to call it that uh from outside predominantly from the Middle East. But the ih it's by no means a combined   element you know it's misleading to say that that there is a a coordinated ch uh Chechen uh resistance movement because uh some groups are just bandit groups criminal groups uh there are some that are operating under warlords and in fact what happened after uh ninety-six when uh the Russians   basically signed a peace agreement with the Chechens and Maskhadov became president uh one of the things the Russians had promised was to rebuild Chechnya because the infrastructure had been destroyed and uh Maskhadov ended up not being able to control the elements who   engage in criminality because there there basically were no jobs and uh so he lost control and then he was displaced by the Russians who put their own person in. So y'know it's sort of it's a it's been a mixed picture over recent years.\n"," Now Vladimir Putin has promised tough new measures to deal with this uh problem. If that means sending in the Russian troops again as they did back in nineteen-ninety-nine  w w w what do you think that would achieve.\n"," Well the the Russians are still the Russian troops are still there I mean it just would mean more sending more troops in. Um I'm not sure that he can actually quash the resistance because you know it's mountainous country and uh and these people I are there for the longer term I mean they can always flee into into surrounding areas too so um I doh I don't think that Putin even with sort of a tough approach can actually resolve a situation   and because of the the number of Chechens that live in Russia itself there's always gunna be a fifth column in Russia that is capable of doing   or supporting activities in Russia anyway so I mean I don't think the the tough approach which he promised previously you might remember  is gunna work I th I think really what it needs is some sort of negotiated agreement   which would involve something like y'know the Marshall plan which rebuilt Europe but rebuilding Chechnya so that people do have alternatives   y'know uh and a vested interest in becoming part of the of a normal economy.\n"," Do you think that negotiation is a possibility.\n"," Uh well it would have to be brokered by somebody outside and that's g a difficulty for the Russians because uh Putin would be very reluctant to allow anyone else to come in as an honest broker I think. Uh but I think that's probably the only way it could be resolved because the Chechens don't tru trust the Russians and the Russians don't trust the Chechens so   y'know it's gunna be very difficult to get them to agree on anything without somebody else being involved.\n"," Okay well uh if Putin wouldn't uh approve of that he's got to approve of something. He's gotta do something.\n"," Yeah I mean what he's facing I think is more of the same frankly I mean I don't think they'll go for a school again because   uh the people involved this time were heavily criticised uh particularly from the Middle East for doing that. So I think that that was a very bad po uh choice of target I mean apart from the tragedy of it all and so on. Um so I think that they'll probably continue to focus maybe on bombings of trains and subway stations and perhaps aircraft that sort of thing in Russia itself which   they can do with relative impunity.\n"," Yep. Russia's been accused of being the creator of the Chechen problem itself because of the   the brutal repression it uh perpetrated there years ago and did for did for years the brutality that existed there do you think that that  has got uh much to do with what occur uh is occurring now.\n"," Certainly because um y'know the probably the most committed people are what are called the black widows. And these are uh the widows of of people who have been killed by the Russians or they're women who have been raped by the Russians   um or have had family members killed by the Russians y'know who are quite prepared to suicide themselves in order to kill Russians. And uh y'know that that's gunna be an ongoing problem for them I think that um uh really they're not th I don't think the Russians are really capable of subduing the situation in Chechnya at the present time.\n"," For the past couple of years since that debacle at the theatre it's been relatively quiet until uh of late with the aeroplanes and the other problems uh they had. Do you think it'll quieten down again for a while or will this cause it to escalate.\n"," Uh well what we've been seeing in recent times is is a spreading of the problem and a more radicalisation of the problem so   uh it might be that they've y'know they'll they've got limited capability to sustain this kind of level of activity but I think we'll see another resurgence of this kind of activity uh maybe in a year's time or whatever if they're not capable of continuing these sorts of activities for the present time.\n"," Yeah how powerful is this rebel leader this Shamil Basayev. Is uh would he have condoned the school siege if he'd known about it.\n"," Uh well they say not I mean the Chechen  were saying this was people from Ingushetia and it was mainly Ingushetia with a few outsiders involved and not Chechens. Now that might be blurring it a bit I mean the Russians are saying of course that it's uh it's international terrorism and and so on. I mean the the truth probably lies somewhere between those two things there probably were some Chechens involved with the uh Ingush fighters that went in there and uh so it's probably a bit more of a mixed picture.\n"," Yeah uh authorities uh say that ten of the hostage takers were arabs   would that  uh would that indicate an Al Qaeda involvement.\n"," Uh mm si ih ih in in part yeah I mean it's sort of it's a it's hard to sort of be specific about that because   a lot of these people who are engaged in these sort of conflicts and go to assist whether it be Kosovo or or wherever or Iraq perhaps are basically travelling jihad fighters who look for good causes to fight for a and and go accordingly so   I mean in terms of the numbers I I don't know because I haven't seen from the Russians a a number given of of of arabs say. At the moment the last figure I saw was that they thought there twenty-seven but   um that they that they killed and that there were others maybe that escaped and they don't therefore know   the totality of it all but I'm not sure uh how many uh ultimately were say were arabs but say there were ten. Um that doesn't necessary signify that these were Al Qaeda people they might well uh ha  with Al Qaeda  but simply be ri well they're not really mercenaries 'cos they're not fighting for money but um they they're sort of y'know they have they are fellow travellers in other words.\n"," Yeah. So where do you think it'll go now Clive what do you think'll happen in the immediate future.\n"," Uh I think both sides'll probably take stock now. Uh obviously the Russians need to think about how they're gunna improve their C T capability because that's really uh uh shocking I think there  the way that they handled things and they haven't learned the lesson from previous uh situations like you mentioned the theatre and previous sieges of hospitals and so on. Uh they really need to get their act together uh because it seems to be that the Russian military's idea of a successful   situation is where all the hostage takers are killed and y'know  ours would be that the hostages are rescued you know. It seems to be a different a   ap uh perception of how things should should develop and I think they're really gunna have to get their act together   and become more professional in the way that say our S A S is.\n"," Okay. Clive Williams I appreciate your time very much it was interesting to talk to you and I thank you.\n"," Thanks John.\n"," Bye. Clive Williams who's international terrorism expert with the Strategic and Defence Study Centre at the A N U. A very interesting fella and there's the story. They certainly will have some work to do in Russia when it comes to the   security of uh of their people. Uh Putin has made all sorts of uh   verbal promises but uh I suppose it'll take him some time to get   something uh concrete into place sooner the better.\n","\n","\n"," Debbie what can I do for you.\n"," Hi John.\n"," Hi.\n"," As a mother of three I'm a little bit concerned about this um this dreadful travesty that's happened in Russia.\n"," Unbelievable.\n"," I um actually sat down on Saturday night and cried it's just heart wrenching and I I couldn't begin to imagine what they're they're feeling at the moment but the pond scum that did this   deserve to rot in hell they're just the lowest form of of anything.\n"," Yeah well if you uh if you have faith in that kind of thing you can bet your boots they will be rotting in hell  even as we speak.\n"," Well it's y'know it's just I I sat down and thought y'know maybe what is the world going to be like in thirty years time when my grandchildren are living. You know.\n"," Well that's what we've all got to think about.  And that and that's why we've gotta understand that we can't allow this kind of behaviour to go on  that we can't uh accept it as a as a form of life on this planet. It's just uh hideous to think that these people have   a belief that they can do what ever they want for their own ends even if it means destroying the lives of beautiful little children.\n"," No it's wrong.\n"," More than wrong it's uh dreadful.\n"," Absolutely. Well  thanks for that John.\n"," Okay Debbie.\n"," Take care.\n"," And you.\n"," Bye.\n"," Bye. I think we all feel the same don't we.\n","\n","\n"," Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two our telephone number Peter what can I do for you.\n"," Yeah how are you John.\n"," I'm very well what about you.\n"," Uh good thank you good. Uh mate I was just down having lunch at your establishment a couple of weeks ago . Down there at beautiful Woolloomooloo Bay there.\n"," Oh were you at Otto.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Yeah isn't it nice.\n"," Oh beautiful spot  beautiful.\n"," Yeah really .\n"," Had a lovely time with my girl and I and uh we really enjoyed ourselves.\n"," Good I'm happy that you did.\n"," Mate we sat down beside you and my partner was very gobsmacked she couldn't   breath   type thing she didn't know what to say y'know to wish she got a shock that we were even going there. Anyway. Mate what I wanted to ask you you were having a beer  at the time and it was in a had a green label on it I've never seen it before I was just wondering what it was.\n"," I think it might have been Boag's.\n"," Boag's was it.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Oh okay.\n"," It coulda been 'cos I tried that a couple of times. I've gotta tell you that I normally drink um   uh Crown Lager.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Or if I want a light beer I drink Sterling. But I tried that I think it's called James Boag B O A G is that it.\n"," Oh okay yeah. I've just ne never seen it before so   I just thought I'd ask you the question .\n"," Well it was pretty g it was pretty good beer served very cold it was terrific but I like that uh old Crown Lager and if I'm gonna  have a light one that's uh have you tried Sterling.\n"," Ah yes I have.\n"," Yeah I think if y if you're gunna have a light beer that's probably the best of all the light beers.\n"," It's fine.\n"," Okay and I'm glad  that you went down there Peter and I'm happy you had a good time I'll see you another time down there.\n"," Good on you mate thank you.\n"," Okay.\n"," Okay.\n"," Bye  bye.\n","\n","\n"," Two is our telephone number John what can I do for you.\n"," Good morning John first time speaker man.\n"," Oh really well that's very nice of you to call.\n"," Uh I've got a spreadsheet in front of me about all the trouble spots in the world  and the common denominator is Muslim.\n"," That's true.\n"," Now are these Muslims following exactly what the Koran is saying about the infidels.\n"," Yeah well it depends how yes they are w we're the infidels the western world   are the infidels.\n"," Yes but why don't the straight Muslims or the good Muslims come out and defend that.\n"," I have no idea. Maybe they're frightened but they don't we say time after time after time   why aren't the good Muslim people and they assure me that there are many and I'm sure I know many. Why aren't they standing in up and uh saying that this behaviour is not acceptable under any circumstances anywhere.\n"," Uh now these good Muslims they read the same Koran.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Uh does the Koran say that the infidel must be searched out and destroyed.\n"," Yeah.\n"," It does  I've read it too but I come from the Middle East.\n"," I see where.\n"," Uh Malta.\n"," Okay.\n"," And you know we're we're told about this when we're four years of age. You know   our .\n"," Yeah well well that's well John that's called indoctrination and and that's what it is.\n"," Now I'm I'm I'm a Catholic.\n"," Yeah I know I.\n"," I I I I don't care what anybody's beliefs are   as long as they do by their neighbour what they'd have 'em do to them.\n"," That's right well that's not a bad rule by which to live.\n"," Yeah but why must can't they come out and explain to us that these people are wrong and disown them.\n"," Well th it's up to them to do it. I I have to say that a number of Chechens have uh now come out and made it very clear that they didn't   approve but who in the world in their right mind could approve of uh what went on   there in Russia. Who could have uh approved of that but the.\n"," But the Koran approves it.\n"," Well that's wuh it would depending uh on the uh depending on the perception you want to take from the Koran the same as it depends   upon the uh impression the interpretation you want to take from the Bible.\n"," Yes you can not follow  but it nowhere in the Bible does it say you must kill all Anglicans all Presbyterians or Methodists.\n"," No that's right.\n"," So.\n"," But it does in the Koran say the infidels have gotta go. And the greatest infidels according to fanatical Muslims   are the western world us Great Britain.\n"," So we're in trouble aren't we.\n"," We you bet we're in trouble.\n",".\n"," You bet we're in trouble and we're in more trouble   because of our n uh neccessary involvement with uh George W Bush   and what went on in Iraq. But I mean we had to be involved there we had to   support George W Bush because we n need the allies. But you're right you said it John. We're in trouble.\n","\n","\n"," Sydney saw an early start to the storm season yesterday with a couple of hail storms hitting uh a lot of the city of Sydney. There had been forecasts of storms but the the hail was a bit unexpected. On the line is the Manager of the Forecast Office of the Weather Bureau Andrew Trelor Andrew good morning.\n"," Yeah good morning John.\n"," What happened.\n"," Oh look we had us some some very cold conditions go over us yesterday. And it just tended to kick the hail off a bit more than what we'd expected.\n"," Yeah weh it really did it was really cold and the thing that I found extraordinary was that the hail lay around for a long long while after.\n"," Yeah that's one of the characteristics of hailstorms outside of the that sort of the main hail season is that you you tend to get lots of little hail and it tends to pile up pretty deep on the ground.\n"," That's what happened.\n"," Yeah and rather than in the in the main hail season where you you tend to get bigger hail but there's there's less of it. So  in a way it's y'know about the same amount of mass isn't it but um in in the winter time or the the late um early spring type storms though it tends to lie pretty thick on the ground.\n"," Yeah it does I don't uh I don't think it would have been damaging hail would it.\n"," We had some reports of hail um between two and four centimetres in diameter. So that's certainly severe  but um they were they were fairly um fairly widely spaced and I'm don't think there was that much damage apart from the whole clogging up gutters which is what it tends to do.\n"," That's that's right and then  you get flooding.\n"," Yeah that's right yeah.\n"," Are we going to see more of it.\n"," Well not today um today we're looking fine for hail and um we're just getting into the start of the storm season now so people should be aware that um y'know there the frequency of these storms will increase over the next few months and peaking at about November December that's when we have most of our hail.\n"," Okay we had last night a second storm coming through I think about half past nine ten o'clock  or somewhere about then. Is that a bit unusual to get a second one so quickly after the first.\n"," Oh given the the weather setup uh it wasn't. Um we had as I mentioned a lot of cold air coming over us and also a low pressure system in the area and that tends to to aid the storms in their in their development. So it wasn't unusual to get another one um but the the one later at the one in the in the evening was actually the one which had um the largest hail and and and the most severity with it.\n"," Yeah well I didn't get to see that one 'cos I I was inside I saw the earlier one and it just lay on the terrace  and really as you said it was smaller hail but it just piled up it was like snow.\n"," Yeah that's right and uh I think some people took advantage of that.\n"," I think they did too.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Okay so so no storms in the near future.\n"," No um not at least for today or in into the next couple of days but there is some rain on the way   um for Sydney um perhaps tomorrow and into Wednesday. So um people should pr hopefully be um b grateful of that.\n"," Yeah oh well we need to be grateful for anything we get given the situation.\n"," Yeah that's right.\n"," Thank you Andrew good to talk to you.\n"," Okay pleasure John.\n"," Bye.\n","\n","\n"," You need them. Are you there Muriel.\n"," Yes John good morning.\n"," Morning.\n"," Um I still have hail all over my back yard.\n"," Is that right.\n"," Yes and the front a little bit of it's starting to melt across the road it's melted   but the sun's just swinging around to the front of my house   and uh I've still got hail all over the front.\n"," Wow.\n"," But it was a dreadful storm we had it at nine o'clock last night   and the hail came down for a quarter of an hour.\n"," Yeah well the early one the the hail was pretty continuous too did it do any damage Muriel.\n"," No I've had a look around I y'know I'm terribly frightened of n uh the glass you can replace it's the roof I worry about more.\n"," Y oh yeah sure.\n"," More than anything you know.\n"," Yeah but it didn't damage the roof.\n"," No it didn't damage it the only my son has a lot of fruit trees down the back and it did belt them around a bit y'know his lemons and oranges and grapefruit and his apples and so forth.\n"," Yeah well I think he'll get over that alright.\n"," Oh he's not worried about that he said as long as the house is okay.\n"," Yeah well he's very nice boy. Okay Muriel nice to talk to you and thank you that's uh you're at Merrylands and there's still hail lying around there.\n","\n","\n"," Okay Julie.\n"," Morning John how are you love.\n"," Pretty good thank you.\n"," I've still got me hail in Mascot here broke me gazebo but .\n"," Oh did it really was it that heavy.\n"," Yes it was it's out here in a big bucket now so yeah.\n"," Okay  and broke your gazebo is the uh top of the gazebo glass or.\n"," No it's just y'know one of them material ones it's el cheapo .\n"," Yeah well it's a  el holo now.\n"," Mm holey it is .\n"," Okay so that's  at Mascot and there's st and there's still some uh hail hanging around.\n"," Yeah it's still out here I c can looh I'm looking at it now so yeah. The dog doesn't know what to do with it but he's fine .\n",".\n"," Alright love can I say cheerio to me mum.\n"," Course you can.\n"," She's in Maryborough in hi Barb hi Harry . Thanks love.\n"," Okay Julie.\n","\n","\n"," Julie.\n","\n","\n"," Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two if you'd like to talk to us uh Glen.\n"," How you going.\n"," Very well thank you.\n"," And uh how're things up there.\n"," Very good thank you. But what  can I do for you.\n"," No I was just listening to the radio a while ago when they were talking about uh the problem in Chechnya and   a lady was making comment about   uh good Muslims making a stand against people who are causing the problems.\n"," Yeah.\n"," But uh you've gotta remember in the crusade days it was the uh Christians who went down into the Islamic area and tried to convert all them into uh into the Christian faith.\n"," That's right. They're getting their own back now aren't they.\n"," It really wasn't uh ih well they weren't doing any trouble until someone come along and started butchering them.\n"," Yeah well the wheel goes round. But  buh  but we but we can't uh we can't be too concerned about   what happened then in the crusades because we can't do anything about it . But we can be con   we can be concerned about what's going on now because we can do something about it.\n"," Well that's right the way it is now everyone's gotta get along everyone's gotta be truthful with each other and try and make amends with what's happened before.\n"," Yeah it's unlikely to happen.\n"," Well you hope it does.\n"," You hope it does and you hope it can be done peaceably whether that's  uh possible or not I can't tell you.\n"," I've got uh uh relatives who are Islamic faith and couldn't find nicer people.\n"," Yep well that's  quite o quite often the case and that's what we say constantly   uh you can't uh you can't paint everybody with the same brush you can't tar everybody with the same brush because   a lot of people who subscribe to the Islamic faith are perfectly good people.\n"," Well that's the other thing when they whene whenever you hear them mentioned they always say Islamic or Muslim terrorists  it shouldn't say that they're just terrorists. Because you've got terrorists in every religion if you want to  use the religion as a point of view.\n"," No no Glen.\n"," Yes.\n"," You just have a look.\n"," Yes.\n"," Certainly every person of the Islamic faith is not a terrorist  but almost without exception   every terrorist is of the Islamic faith.\n"," What about Northern Ireland where the northern .\n"," I said almost without exception.\n"," Okay.  I know what you mean.\n"," Yeah and sad  and sadly it's true Glen it's uh it is true.\n","\n","\n"," Okay Lee-Anne.\n"," Hi John. Um I'm ringing up um w um I'm a I'm a Greens supporter.\n"," I see.\n"," Um it's I'm very surprised that in these times of all the turmoil and that that's going on that everybody isn't a Greens supporter.\n"," I see. Why do you support the Greens what do you think they're gunna do.\n"," Well they support life   basically that's people that is the people like we've got.\n"," Doh d don't you think that that.\n"," We need help in our education we need help in our hospitals our medical our dental   we that's life.\n"," Yeah what's what's the Greens' policy on health.\n"," Well they haven't really had a chance. That like they don't have the backing they don't have the knowledge they haven't got the basic like the funding the ability to have   like much knowledge in anything at the moment.\n"," No well well I know but what what would happen if they had power in the Senate and they could do things   what do you think they might do about health.\n"," Well I'm sure that they wouldn't be harming anybody like the basic policy of it is life is love.\n"," Yeah do you  well well that's all of that's that's pretty good Lee-Anne but tell me this do you think uh ecstasy's good.\n"," Of course it's not good that's an artificial that's not life.\n"," Okay well why then would the Greens want to have it sold over the counter.\n"," I don't think I think that's propaganda that.\n"," It's not propaganda you can go to their website and have a look you'll find it there.\n"," Oh I  I'm very sceptical about that.\n"," Well sweetheart it's there W W W dot Greens dot org dot A U and you'll find it.\n"," I d oh yeah I'm still very sceptical like there is a lot of things that are said about the Liberals and the Labors that's  not true.\n"," D buh that's right but I'm talking about their policy on their website. Would you like to be riding a bike   instead of driving in a car.\n"," I don't I don't see the relevance.\n"," Well that's something else the Greens would like to do they'd like to get you outta your car and onto a push bike.\n"," I don't think so.\n"," Well sweetheart you get.\n"," They they don't want war they don't want turmoil  they're not going to .\n"," Could could you name wuh could you name  for me Lee-Anne  name wuh name for me one person who wants war.\n"," Well I well we we all know that we've made mistakes the country has made mistakes.\n"," I know but who but who wants war.\n"," Well hopefully ain't nobody.\n"," That's right so why is anybody else any different to the Greens.   I mean if you if you think all this is a lotta hogwash just go to their the Greens' website and have a look. Would you do you think it's a good idea that Medicare should pay for sex change operations.\n"," Oh no I don't think all this propagat .\n"," Okay well the Greens think uh that Medicare should pay for sex change operations.   Do you agree do you agree with same sex marriages.\n"," I don't think that it's relevant any of that like the v.\n"," Well it's r  well well well listen now listen l  uh Lee-Anne it's it's relevant if these people.\n"," 'Cos really is Labor or Liberal are they talking about these policies.\n"," No g.\n"," No.\n"," The g the Greens are. It's the Greens' policy. And they're recommending ecstasy and other illegal drugs be sold over the counter.\n"," Oh but will it ever get it would never get passed.\n"," Well why but  why should we but but why should we even take the uh take the risk. I mean you're planning to give them your vote which is a hugely valuable thing a hugely valuable thing  and you're gunna give them your vote  shouldn't you be   across their ideas. What about higher taxes wouldn't worry you too much no. .\n"," Well like I've had I've had my neighbour my neighbour was admitted five times   through like by a ambulance and and released the next day. Two weeks later he died.  This is our medical system  I'd rather have my neighbour alive and well and happy.\n"," Okay and do you believe if the Greens had power in the Senate that your neighbour would be alive.\n"," Yes I do.\n"," You really do.\n"," Yes I do.\n"," Well you're stupid.\n"," Well I don't think I am I think that they  alive.\n"," You are stupid you are stupid I'm sorry you are stupid.  You are talking about voting for the Greens you have no idea what they stand for  they want to get outta your motor cars and put you on a bike   but thuh they uh do you enjoy a good steak every now and again.\n"," I do.\n"," Yeah okay well the Greens would prefer that you were a vegetarian.\n"," I don't think so .\n"," I'm telling you what it.\n"," You're going to the extreme you don't  even know the party.\n"," I am telling you what is on the website.\n"," Ah well  that's a lot of hogwash I think.\n"," Well I agree with you it's a lotta hogwash but it's what they believe.\n"," I don't think so.\n"," Listen I know a lot more.\n"," I I know a lot of Green supporters that do not  believe  that garbage.\n"," Well they're all stupid too.\n"," Well  there's no use somebody ringing up and supporting the Greens if you're gunna treat 'em like th you are now.\n"," W wuh wuh I'm I'm not I'm not  being rude to you  I'm just telling I'm telling you the truth.\n"," Well I don't believe your .\n"," I know m I know more about the I know more about the Greens' policies than you do and you intend to vote for them.\n"," Well it's obvious you're a Liberal supporter and I'm gunna hang up.\n"," Why why uh no why is it obvious I'm a Liberal supporter.  What the hell's that got to do.\n"," You don't wanna hear that why   you don't wanna vote for life if you sit there and say that.\n"," Who said who said I don't want to vote for life it's the most treasured thing that we that we have.\n"," Hopefully it is.\n"," Yeah well and and it is but but you've you've got it wrong about the Greens. I'm sure you're well intentioned I'm sure   you really think that a vote for the Greens is really gunna help   Australia well I'm telling you   that it's not gunna change a thing. They won't have the power to do anything about th the death of your next door neighbour   but they m might have the power to encourage people to have same sex marriages and to have ecstasy sold over the counter to kids your kids maybe. You got any kids.\n"," I don't believe it. It's like saying well if we vote   if we vote Liberal we're for sure we're gunna buy more arms   and go to war.  It's like y'know .\n"," I I d I don't believe that's I don't believe that's part of the Liberal agenda but.\n"," Well I for sure.\n"," But what but what I'm saying.\n"," Lot of people believe it is part  of the Liberal agenda.\n"," Well a lot of people believe incorrectly and you believe   you believe.\n"," You you're telling me I believe incorrectly well that's  life.\n"," Well you do believe incorrectly .\n"," Sorry John I've gotta go .\n"," Yeah okay sweetheart well I'm sorry I mean I'm not meaning to be rude to you I'm simply telling you the truth you're stupid.\n","\n","\n"," Yeah who was in power during the first Gulf War Lee-Anne my dear it wasn't Liberal was it. It was Labor. Nobody likes war   but I can't believe that people are going to say blindly yeah I'm gunna vote for the Greens because they're pro life pro life of what pro their own damn life. They don't care much about the lives of children if they're talking about   uh ecstasy and other illegal drugs being sold over the counter to young people. G g say heroin and marijuana they'd like that to be sold as well. Now you go and have a look at their website   all you people that's worth doing I'm certainly not telling   telling you what to vote and you d have no idea in the world what I vote I'm simply telling you   to be warned.\n","\n","\n"," Ker  good morning.\n"," Uh yeah is it me Khaar.\n"," Well if that's your name.\n"," Oh yeah yeah but thanks John.\n"," Okay.\n"," Uh first time caller.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Uh I like your show recently converted a few months ago from two G B.\n"," Good.\n"," Um I don't agree with all the things that you uh say but you know on the whole I I I I find that you try to be objective.\n"," I do.\n"," It was good that you brought this guy on who gave a dispassionate view of the events in in Chechnya and the historical background   and all that. Uh that so that was good and I expect that sort of thing and people generally would expect that  uh but straight after that you launched into a gross distortion of uh the uh uh uh uh teachings of the Koran. One of the oft quoted phrases in the Koran is \n"," Yeah well that's that's really nice say it again you go you go your way let me go mine.\n"," Exactly and it's a very oft quoted su phrase in in in in in the Koran .\n"," And it's very nice.\n"," No-one seems to mention that but you said the the Koran says that .\n"," But but no hang on just before we get away from this Ker  uh I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly am I.\n"," Khaar yeah.\n"," Khaar.\n"," Yep.\n"," Okay uh b uh uh bl you go your way you go mine th all of that's  okay all all of that's very good. So why doesn't uh the fanatical Muslim let the Christian go his way  instead of instead of wanting to kill him.\n"," Oh well there are fundamentalists say in ever religion then there are people who distort the teachings.\n"," Yeah well that's what I said.\n"," And and and and and and and there are uh you know and 'n' there are extra and there is a big debate going on in  in the Islamic world we may be y'know where where uh maybe you're not aware of that   and and  how how how best how best to uh counter this on the wuh on the one hand we don't w want to fall into the laps of those who are you know uh those we have declared to be sworn enemies of Islam on the other hand we want don't want you to think that really play into their hands like in you know like killing innocent people and that sort of thing.\n"," No terrible.\n"," But now look go back to where what I was try uh uh alluding to y'know this the the Koran doesn't say that the infidels have to be destroyed   because the Koran gives everyone the right to have their opinion   and that was the basis on which the Prophet fought and won so I think when you said I I cuh I could understand if you it w if ih if it was an honest ignorance but you said as if you knew as if you .\n"," Well now well well now now Khaar wuh uh just hang on a minute. I mean the Koran you're talking about uh is being interpreted correctly by somebody with an understanding you're very articulate you speak very good English   and you use all the correct words uh and what you're referring to is a Koran that is unknown to people who are fanatical they you read it the right way they read it the wrong way all this business about you go your way I'll go mine   stuff  if if that's the case why don't  the fanatical Muslims  let let the infidels go their way.\n"," I'll I'll I'll tell where because the the the the misrepresentation might occur from. The the Koran does say that if the infidels attacks you with a view to impose their beliefs and opinions on you you have a right to destroy them.\n"," That's right.\n"," So maybe they are trying to interpret that because you know ih is the fact that you know there are things going on where where where you know Muslims and Muslim countries are being ye you know ih ih 'n' you know things that are happening and you may have your views about that uh that to Muslims don't appear to be and you'll find that ina unanimous amongst Muslims that  ninety-nine percent whether they are living in the United States or wherever they they are completely opposed to what the United States are doing a and and and and and so maybe some of this ha uh comes from that uh you know and the .\n"," That does but but in in fairness to me and you've gotta be fair to me  when I when when I talk about Muslims I say the majority of them are terrific people and they probably do r read the Koran as its meant to be read and they practice peace but ye its very difficult to say that that Islam is a is a religion of peace when you look what's going on what just what just happened in Russia for God's sake.\n"," Yeah but but again that's a distortion because nothing the I think that guy that you brought on uh that spoke about the background of Chechnya I mean I I think he did a very good job.  the background has n n nothing to do with religion. Its uh the Chechens never liked Russia they were never they uh.\n"," Yeah I  I I I know I know that I I can't talk for too long I I know what you're saying there but it is to do with religion because the people who committed that frightful crime against humanity  were Muslims.\n"," Well well they were born Muslims but they they didn't have they didn't say they were doing it for Islam they just happened to be Muslims like you see all these countries .\n"," Okay so they happened to be Muslims but what they did wasn't too good was it.\n"," No no no definitely not. I you know I I would support a y'know I would support any action they take to liberate their country a a and there is a lot of hypocrisy going on about that in Palestine in Iraq and many other places uh but y'know to target uh children I know you know a lot of these young see you know women actually do those whose brothers and husbands  have been killed.\n"," But but let let me say this to you that the theatre   drama that took place two years ago in Russia when a hundred and twenty-nine people  died.\n"," That was wrong too yeah I don't .\n"," That w that was wrong too but again that was Muslims that was extreme Muslims.  So why why almost without exception wherever we look where terrorism is perpetrated it is perpetrated by extremists  of the Islamic faith.\n"," Y y you're trying to identify the uh people and not the action you see the thing that they they did the wrong thing y'know they may be born Muslim or Christian I don't care they did the wrong thing  I do support their desire to become independent and the struggle for that.\n"," If that was uh  if that if that's the real desire yeah.\n"," Yeah yeah but you know I I can an I can understand uh h why why they're feeling so desperate I can I can understand that too .\n"," But you can't take the lives of children just  because you're feeling desperate.\n"," You can't but but you know it's it's a vicious cycle no one is talking about what the Russians did in Chechnya.\n"," No.\n"," The whole place has been destroyed it's been.\n"," Well well.\n"," Just look at a picture of Grozny.\n"," Oh okay  well the man that I talked to this morning in fact did talk about what the the Russians have done uh to the Chechens  uh and said that the women called the black widows respond on their behalf because they've been raped or family have been killed so so we are made a bit uh aware of that but we can't alter the fact that this it you want to believe that it's not based on religion that's fine but I  I do know that the Muslims are looking for an independent state   in Chechnya.\n"," Well they're they're looking for a state and some are arguing that re it's it it needs to be a religious one and others are the Chechnyans are they hold their faith very dearly  you know it's up to them really .\n"," Yeah well it well it is up to them but why were all the people who involved  with this Muslim.\n"," As a matter of fact though there there's very small Christian and other minorities they do also support this movement they are very insignificant but they also go along with this uh idea of independence they never liked .\n"," The independence for Chechnya but not independence uh for a for a free independent Muslim state. I've gotta g I've gotta go Khaar I'm not uh cutting you short I've given you a lotta time and I appreciated talking to you and I thank you for your   rational approach to it we just uh differ a little bit on uh   who the infidels are or how they should be treated but you said in there that uh   the the law of Islam allowed if people were forcing you to believe in some other faith you had the right to retaliate. I haven't noticed the Americans trying to force uh the Islamic race to believe in any other faith have you.\n","\n","\n"," His name incidentally was spelt K H double A R pronounced keeya. And uh he was a nice fellow and very good command of the English language. Jill good morning.\n"," Good morning John how are you.\n"," Very well thanks.\n"," Look I'm hoping you can help me I was reading the Sun Herald yesterday and in their last word uh on the back page   there is an article s about the bad blood between John Coates and Dawn Fraser.\n"," Yeah.\n"," And it states in here that Coates does not want any of our young girl swimmers especially Jodie Henry to be associated with Fraser now or in the future.\n"," Does it give a reason.\n"," It says Coates is still fuming about Fraser's views on him before the games. But I mean y'know come on let's get real here we're talking about Dawn Fraser.\n"," That's right yeah . That's r that well you've said it very well yeah we're we are toh but even if we weren't talking about Dawn Fraser wouldn't matter much who we were talking about uh the point is that you can't instruct people to whom they should speak.\n"," That's tr .\n"," I mean I c I can't tell you listen I happen to know your neighbour and I don't like the bastard don't you speak to him again.\n"," That's right.\n"," You'd laugh at me.\n"," I mean I was just wondering John is it right or is it .\n"," I don't know I'll I'll have to have a look at it.\n"," Yeah it's on the uh it's on what they class as the last word. And it comes down there's a thing it's a rather funny um headline animal magnetism   and it's talking about Jana Pittman and then the next thing it says the bad blood between John Coates and Dawn Fraser appears to be getting worse.\n"," Yeah well I've I've gotta tell you I really don't know why.\n"," No neither do I.\n"," I really don't know why. And I can't remember precisely what Dawn  had to say.\n"," No I know I know there was a big outcry about her not going being invited over there.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Um so whether she came out and said something about that I've .\n"," I know she know she was a only the only criticism I remember from her was she was critical about   being snubbed  uh by the AOC but they claimed she hadn't been uh snubbed at all she'd been offered all the attention she'd need when she got there. Now maybe the whole thing is a a misunderstanding. But misunderstanding or not misunderstanding   as you said we're talking about Dawn Fraser. If she  so she misunderstood so what  she's still Dawn Fraser.\n"," That's right well we went to the Olympic trials my daughter and I   we were there the night that young Libby Lenton broke the hundred metre record  and the first person down on that pool deck to congratulate her was Dawn Fraser.\n"," Yeah wuh that's Dawney.\n"," That's right y'know  I mean y'know and these girls look up to her.\n"," Yeah let me see if we we can get some more detail ih it's not a very uh it's not a very uh detailed sort of  piece is it.\n"," No it's only like y'know a a spot they class as their last word so I mean it's only a um like a paragraph on it. But it just sort of stood out and I thought now what's going on here.\n"," Yeah and where wuh when you say it is Dawn you've gotta remember   until Jodie Henry came along the last Australian to win a hundred metre Olympic gold medal was Dawn Fraser.\n"," That's exactly right.\n"," Yeah   okay good to talk to you Jill  I understand exactly what you're saying.\n"," Okay thanks John.\n"," Alright.\n"," Bye.\n"," Bye.\n","\n","\n"," Well Jan you waited a while there didn't you.\n"," Good morning John it was worth it I was so hot under the collar when I rang you then you did that lovely interview with that lovely lady.\n"," Yeah love her  she's great.\n"," Calmed my blood pressure down about ten points.\n"," Good what were you angry about.\n"," Well first of all I'll I'll just thank you for taking that call on the Greens. I hope that you continue to take every call you can get because these people sitting on the fence that are saying oh I'll just give the Greens my vote   they need to know what sorta people vote for them and they need to know their policies and if you keep doing that I'm sure you'll enlighten a lotta people.\n"," Yeah well it's pretty important to understand a  a pa a party's policies.\n"," My word John and half the people that you talk to talking to the Greens they don't know a policy.\n"," We s and that's why I call them watermelons 'cos they're Green on the outside  but they're let me tell you red on the inside they're they have got some very strange views.\n"," Right what I did ring you about John I just wanted to vent a little bit about the press and I'm sure you'll agree with me on this   uh the things that are coming out in the press to do with the election and everything uh it's annoying me how stupid they must ti think people are. I mean my dad v was a very wise man and I you'd agree with this I'm sure for what you've copped   but he always told me to cut everything in half that you read in the paper and believe a quarter of it.  And you might get somewhere near the truth. John just an example for weeks we had this Mark Latham was gunna give free books to s children. And at the tax payer's expense. Never once did I see it written or heard it reported on Australia has free books we have one of the best public library systems in the world.\n"," We do you're right.\n"," Paid for by the public's purse. John schools have fabulous libraries where those children can bring home a book   if a mum and dad wants to read a book to a child they're there at any time to read. And ih y'know I mean another thing with the P M saying that he will he might not be there in three years   John can you tell me that any leader of any party can guarantee that their party will not change through these .\n"," Course they ca course they can't.\n"," Mark Latham could get in and do something stupid and open that big mouth of his again and the Labor party could vote him out in a couple of months John.\n"," It could happen.\n"," There's no guarantee.\n"," Uh no guarantee of anything.\n"," Yeah and my dad always said to me John a P M is only as good as his treasurer and my I'm a big John Howard fan but my only fear would be   ih if Peter Costello became prime minister who'd take his place 'cos he's the best treasurer we've ever had and I don't see why anyone's got anything against than man I don't think he's put a food wrong.\n"," Uh who Peter Costello.\n"," Yeah.\n"," No neither do I I think he's terrific.\n"," I mean I don't understand it John I don't watch the serials I tune in on Fox for the to the to the parliament. And John that man he is so astute and so clever I just don't know who ever wih is it the press that's got this thing hanging over his head or what I don't understand that.\n"," Well I don't know either  but uh.\n"," The nice man  and he's a strong man.\n"," Oh I think he's terrific.\n"," So do I and that's my only I would be afraid if John Howard did get put out who'd take t um Peter Costello's place and my other point that I'd like people to think about is absolute power corrupts absolutely and we have every state in Australia Labor and if we had our federal government Labor we might as well all walk to the front door and open up the door and say come on in unions back to the odds and evens petrol day bus strikes standing at a bus strike .\n"," Yeah Jan I've let you go too long .\n"," That's oh .\n"," Thank you very much  for the call.\n"," Good bye-bye.\n"," Bye.  Ah corruption absolute power corrupts absolutely. Um vodka corrupts absolutely.\n","\n","\n"," Well Pat O'Shane has had uh one of her more controversial decisions overruled by the New South Wales   attorney general Bob Debus. She ruled that four men did not have to be tried for attacking a five week old baby. Because they didn't know the baby was hidden inside her father's jacket when they allegedly attacked him in Maroubra last year. But now the attorney general says an ex officio indictment will be issued and the men will be charged with the attack in which the baby suffered brain injuries and a fractured skull. And they could face up to seven years of jail   if convicted. Now uh you can't comment   except to say   why Pat O'Shane   why.\n","\n","\n"," Morning Shirley.\n"," Good morning John.\n"," How are you.\n"," Oh I've had arthritis in my hands for a month but I don't wanna talk about that.\n"," OOh that's no good I'm sorry to hear it what can I do for you.\n"," Oh no it's rotten.\n"," Yeah it's not good.\n"," I just rang to say you made my day.\n"," Why.\n"," Isn't that K D Lang wonderful.\n"," I love her.\n"," And what about that song Crying.\n"," Yeah I know it breaks your heart . I said to her not only did she   inherit the song she improved it it uh it and that's hard to do when somebody like Roy sung it. But it's beautiful.\n"," Absolutely  wonderful I d'y'know I can't sing a note. Uh but I love music I love sport I love everything. I live in a home for the aged and they're all too bloody old . And they don't listen or do anything . And I thought oh you were away for two weeks holiday and I thought oh damn.  So it just reminded me when I heard her sing that song I must get me Johnny Farnham tape out the last time.\n"," Yeah there's some good stuff on that too.\n"," Yeah every time I get depressed I bring it out 'n' I forgotten all about it. But she was wonderful.\n"," Yes she is wonderful and uh Shirley I thank you very much for the call and it's good that you listen   and uh love music it doesn't matter whether you can sing or not just love it 'n' listen to the words and that song Crying is I agree just one of the great song. Joe uh.\n","\n","\n"," Kate good morning.\n"," Good morning John how are you.\n"," Very well thank you.\n"," I like to reply to that lady that you were speaking to earlier in regards to the Greens. Um if she has a look on their website   it might be a bit of an eye opener for her in regards  to their policies.\n"," Wuh well I've asked her she hasn't looked and I doubt very much that she'd know how to work the internet.\n"," Well if she if she can 'n' if she does um if she could have a look at paragraph y under their policy section paragraph three-two-one and three-two-f-four and three-two uh five it's very contradicting it contradicts itself so   so profoundly it's unbelievable buh ih I I can't even understand how it's eh well they would even put it .\n"," Uh hang on just give me those paragraph numbers again  this is a this is after their policies are laid out.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Then paragraphs three-two.\n"," One.\n"," One.\n"," Three-two-three.\n"," Three-two-three and three-two-five.\n"," Yeah um it says there that the penalties for illicit drugs okay it says you can't use um dr illicit drugs if you're a user under under the practices of um in regards to druh um court cases and w and what have you   but if they want to supply um the drugs I mean what sort of an excuse would that leave open to people who are.\n"," Well look sweetheart it's just one of a bunch of crazy things that are on that website 'n' the more people that go and look at it the better. We'll find uh uh three-three-one three-three-four and three-three-five and uh and have a look at them for you Kate we'll have a close look and see if we can work out   what it is you're having a little difficulty understandably there. But we'll have a look at it for you. Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two is our telephone number uh watermelon supporter this is regards Peter to the Green voter who's been led up the garden path to vote for the fairies talk about propaganda the Greens are the experts if you're worried about hospitals after the Greens bankrupt society you'll be lucky to find   a doctor the Greens are actually anti life and go against the laws of nature. Wake up these fools   they aren't what they claim to be thank you for keeping the dream alive regards Peter. Good on you Peter. Well they certainly aren't uh what they want to appear to be we would be I think   quite correct in suggesting that. Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two Catherine good morning.\n"," Hi John how are you.\n"," Very well thank you.\n"," Um look I'm just ringing because um I'm not a Greens supporter but what I have done in the past and um listening to your show is what I'll reconsider doing. Is that I'll I voted for one of the main parties either Liberal or Labor  and then you give your preferences . And you hand them over to a Greens without thinking much because you think well they're for the environment. So you give away your preference and 'cos y you know lotta people really don't think about preferences that much but they do count. Um.\n"," Well they of course they  of course they count.\n"," Yes and I just sort of listening to your show I've never really thought about the Greens um much and I'm quite sure there's plenty of your listeners out there'd be like me. Quite ignorant to their um their policies and such you just sort of view them as   well the Greens who are for the environment don't you.\n"," Well that's what they want you to think but uh there's a lot more to it than that believe me.\n"," Well I've sorta been a bit shocked by sort of going back to the have to have a look at their website and see what you're talking about because um there certainly isn't many of their policies that I would agree to and having young children I   definitely wouldn't agree to their policy of um handing out drugs such as uh ecstas ecstasy  I'm bit  nervous John .\n"," No no you  you're you're alright don't you worry about it Katherine I understand what you're saying   and I imagine it's quite true. A lot of people have simply been giving uh preference votes to the Greens 'cos you think oh well they're pretty safe they're gonna save the trees at least. Uh but you don't know what's behind all this. And what  and what's behind it to my way of thinking is very sinister. Very.\n"," Well I sort of have been quite shocked and um driving around as I say I drive around in my Toyota land cruiser which are sponsors of yours John.\n"," Thank you darling.\n"," Doing my job.\n"," Thank you.\n"," And um listening to you and I've just actually got quite a shock and I I think a lotta people out there are like myself. Um I'm not really politically minded a lot I sort of listen to everything I'm bit of a swinging voter so I sort of look and think well that main group is the ones that suit me and go with those and you give away your preferences and now   my understanding is that preferences do add up they can I'll actually get somebody in.\n"," Oh well they can.\n"," And uh that uh you know you could get a Green in without realising it.\n"," Okay but Katherine what you've gotta remember   is that n nobody you in particular because I'm talking to you uh has follow any party's how to vote card. You should give your own preferences and not just slavishly follow some card that is given to you by some political party. You must choose your own preferences the way you want to. I mean you can vote Labor and give the preferences to Liberal or the other way round you don't have to give them to uh an alternate party. And you can give them to whomever you choose.\n"," Well that's true but as I say you if uh what you're brought out now about them um a lotta people like myself have just viewed them as I suppose a harmless um  party um  you know you you interested in the environment I'm in rural Australia I'm interested in the environment um we're on the land   I know a lotta people don't think farmers are interested in the environment um but we are very much so and  and um you you j just basically you think well you're doing the right thing you're giving it to the party you want give it to somebody that's actually for the environment that are trying to do say good for the country as well but you know preferences I think we your listeners out there like myself might actually um you may not change the ones that have uh are gonna vote for the Greens.\n"," No well that well.\n"," But if you can get people like myself who haven't actually thought about it um thinking about the Greens and what their policies and having a look at them um you know they're not gonna get the preferences and maybe actually might stop a few of them getting in .\n"," Yeah  okay.\n"," don't think will hurt .\n"," Thanks Katherine.  Thanks.\n"," Not a worry.\n"," Thanks  okay.\n"," take my call.\n"," Thank you  thank you uh sweet sweet woman with a nice giggle. Uh they use the the environment thing as their entree card that's how they get in the front door. And then when they're in there look out is it Gerrard.\n","\n","\n"," and cut 1:06:47-1:12:00}\n"," uh s she plays. This is silver ribbon week an annual campaign to increase awareness about ovarian cancer. The ovarian cancer research foundation is having to raise half a million dollars to help develop a test to detect the cancer early and one of its major supporters is Raelene Boyle who knows all about sadly ovarian cancer firsthand   and she's on the line Raelene good morning.\n"," Morning John how are you.\n"," I'm pretty good how are you.\n"," I'm very well actually I'm suffering a bit of jet lag still from coming back from Athens but I'm very well.\n"," How about Athens was that good or what.\n"," Yeah it was fantastic it was um I didn't think that they could pull it together but they did in the end.\n"," Yeah well they did but that's what the Greeks are like it's it's never ready until the last moment and when it is ready it's great.\n"," Well that's what the Australian Greeks kept saying didn't they on television don't worry they'll get it ready well they did.\n"," Yeah and that's uh that's the way with the Greeks. Uh Raelene you were diagnosed with ovarian cancer when wuh when was that.\n"," About six weeks before the Olympics in two-thousand. And uh it was a pretty awful time in my life probably the worst time I've ever had.\n"," I can imagine that it would be. C can you tell us uh wh what the symptoms are.\n"," Well there are no real symptoms that anyone can um   describe that will suit ever woman y'know there's some women can have distended tummies some some women can have a diarrhoea .\n"," Yeah Raelene I'm losing you uh on that telephone we'll   have to try and get Raelene back. Not a great idea to use mobiles if we can   get a solid line because they can   disappear as that one has I want to talk to her about it too she's terrific woman Raelene Boyle. Really terrific and a a great athlete been diagnosed with ovarian cancer but we'll see if we can get her   back on a better line for your sake   uh bad news from the Northern Territory this morning police have confirmed the man who died in a shooting incident yesterday   was a former horse trainer from Sydney called John Morish. Uh it's a tragic story. He'd been on a hunting trip about a hundred and thirty kilometres west of Catherine   fifty-three years of age he suffered a fatal wound on the left side of his chest   just before midday on Saturday. Police have been investigating but they say there are no suspicious circumstances. John Morish had trained a a string of outstanding gallopers Uh March Hare being one of them. He'd also been associate with Takeover Target uh Clocker was another one. He's died in a shooting incident at the age of uh fifty-three but police say no suspicious circumstances.\n","\n","\n"," Yes you're too valuable to lose to a bad mobile phone Raelene.\n"," Sorry about that John.\n"," It's alright it's not your fault. Uh now tell me uh you you were mentioning some of the the symptoms a distended tummy was one you said.\n"," Distended tummy a bit of diarrhoea um just generally feeling unwell   can be some of the symptol simple symptoms it's not something that   sort of jumps at you like breast cancer does where some of the symptoms are are very obvious.\n"," Dih did  do you feel any pain.\n"," Look I'm sure that you feel unwell I I was lucky I had a dog that chased another dog when I was walking it one night and tore the the mass the twelve centimetre mass that was growing in my back  attached to my right ovary.\n"," And that's how it was discovered.\n"," And that's how it was covery discovered she tore the mass and it bled into my back causing acute pain and I went to the doctor had an ultrasound and had surgery within a matter of days.\n"," Well you were unlucky but lucky in a way weren't you.\n"," I was very lucky. I don't see it as unlucky at all I see it as very lucky and then mine unfortunately grew back and so thirteen months later I had a second dose of it where they had to go back inside and take a lot more stuff out.\n"," Uh are you right now are you in remission.\n"," Look I hate that word. Um I'm well at the moment. I I sort of see the word remission as a as a symbol that it's gonna come back.\n"," Yeah I do too.  I do too.\n"," Exactly I just live every day as it comes and I believe that I make the most of them uh and and I look forward to a future. I don't think about the fact that maybe I am in remission   and the word remission to me symbolises that it I'm sitting around waiting for it to come back and I'm not.\n"," How how many Australian women are diagnosed with uh ovarian cancer every year.\n"," It's about two and a half thousand a year. And.\n"," It's a lot.\n"," The terrible the terrible statistic is that one dies every  hours. So about seventy percent of women who are diagnosed um die within five years I think it is.\n"," Is that right.\n"," Yeah it's very scary.\n"," And ih is it correct that there's there's no test for it. How how do they discover it if there's no test for it.\n"," Well there's no early detection test like with with breast cancer you can have mammograms or you can have biopsies on lumps or various things with ovarian cancer there's just no early detection test for it. Um and that's what our research group are working on an early detection test particularly focused at the moment on post-menopausal women.\n"," I see is it more prevalent in post-menopausal women.\n"," Yes. Yes it is it sort of rears its ugly head when the hormones start to go berserk through menopause I think.\n"," Yeah and uh w what do women do if they have a concern uh if there's if  there's no test there's not a lotta point in talking to your doctor.\n"," Oh no there is you go to the doctor your and you talk to your your G P and obviously he would refer the woman if he thought there was something to be checked on to a surgeon and the surgeon would do ultrasounds and check it out very thoroughly um to make sure there were no shadows around the abdominal cavity there and and um and then it would be taken to the next step of surgery and then on to chemo or whatever was necessary or it would just be monitored.\n"," Okay it's a bit frightening isn't it.\n"," It's very frightening but when you see a big corporate like the National Bank getting behind raising funds you appreciate how much good they do in the community and and this is based around funding from the National Bank in in partnership with the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation  who put.\n"," How can we help Raelene.\n"," You can help by or your your you and your listeners can help by going and buying a two dollar ribbon from any National branch. Any National Bank branch they have them on their counters and you'd be surprised how quickly the two dollars add up. When you think about it   you know a very basic poi a um perspective we only need to sell two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand ribbons to raise the half a million dollars we want   and um I hope that a lotta your listeners go out and spend that two dollars.\n"," Okay I'm sure they will Raelene. It was lovely to talk to you and uh I hope you remain fit and well I'm sure you will.\n"," Likewise John thank you.\n"," Thank you bye.\n"," Bye.\n"," Raelene Boyle wonderful woman and uh really been a great athlete and uh a w a wonderful personality and now helping   the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation so if you're in the uh bank and you see the silver ribbon buy one costs you two bucks but it might well be   the best two dollars you've ever spent if it's gunna help discover ovarian cancer   uh maybe you're not concerned about it but maybe you have family young   children women in your family who uh may worry about it one day. So if you can buy the the silver ribbon make a point of doing it would you.\n","\n","\n"," This is interesting uh.

Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two lately Mike are you there.\n"," Yes sir.\n"," Good morning.\n"," Hi how are you.\n"," I'm very well how are you.\n"," Good thank you.\n"," Why did you call me.\n"," Well uh this coming month is the uh first year anniversary of my wife's death she died from ovarian cancer.\n"," How old was your wife.\n"," Uh she was thirty-nine.\n"," Tt tt tt goodness gracious. I'm sorry to hear that.\n"," Mm  we didn't   it was one of those routine check-ups we we wouldn't have known otherwise it was there and they discovered a ten centimetre mass inside the left ovary. And uh when they pulled it out they said it was an extremely rare type of uh ovarian cancer   and there was really um y'know that they they apparently they thought they got it all but then uh after the surgery uh six months later they discovered a second mass that was attached to the back of the abdomen and they couldn't get that out and they they said there was nothing they could do.\n"," Dear dear dear that's terrible that really is terrible have you got children.\n"," Three small children yeah.\n"," Yeah. Are you getting by okay.\n"," Yes we have a lot of support um and uh a lot of family here so yeah we we have support we need.\n"," Tell me this were there uh obviously you telling me there were no symptoms.

So she didn't have any pain or.\n"," Uh not at that time no. Um the the second one um oh even the second one there wasn't a lot of pain to begin with. Uh but uh y'know as the months went on it increased increased and then just in the last probably two or three months it just rapidly deteriorated until sh y'know at the end she couldn't move couldn't speak couldn't do anything.\n"," Terrible.\n"," And that was it.\n"," Terrible. Okay well it's uh your call is a good warning for other people it obviously doesn't simply happen to post-menopausal women   it can happen to thirty thirty-nine did you say.\n"," Yes thirty-nine.\n"," Thirty-nine year old.

Didn't um pack the jumper until tuh no didn't put the jumper on until last night and it was just the most beautiful week it was  still it's just gorgeous they're doing lots of refurbishing at Rottnest so it's quiet like we had the uh Island to ourselves  the lodge is closed  they're putting a new roof on the lodge 'n' the dome is being refurbished so there's lots of things happening over there lots of money being spent over there but it's just happening at the moment of course it's the time to do it when it's quiet so it's just fantastic just the best spot to have a holiday in winter.\n"," D'you wanna go back next week.\n"," I'd love to go  back next week okay  I'd love I'd be there I'd be there tomorrow  yeah definitely it is just just wonderful.\n"," Sounds uh what the doctor ordered.\n"," Rode around the island.

Actually my legs didn't ache so I was lucky about that but um I think it's twuh over twenty kays around the island but it's the hills the hills are pretty steep. And saw lots of whales. There's whales are out there so on the um lookout to the water out to the on the souh southern side of the west end there's lots of whales making their way up the coast.\n"," Isn't it lovely  um I didn't s I went to Albany the week before as you know  to my daughter's place and and son-in-law's huh had a very nice time there I must say and uh they've got a s very nice house do you know Albany at all.\n"," Yep.\n"," Course you do 'cos you come from down there der.\n"," Well no I don't come from  down there but spent time down that way yeah.\n"," Um they got a nice house on Mt Clarence.\n"," Yes.\n"," Overlooking uh the the beach and  and they can see we invested in a pair of binoculars  for them they weren't getting my nik  they were not getting my Nikon twelve-fifties under  any circumstance  but I did get 'em a little pair of uh   eight eight-forties or eight-twenty-fives  I mean still good and we watched 'n' watched 'n' watched we just didn't quite see any whales there but they they they have been coming  in there.\n"," Yep  yeah I know it's just wonderful I think binoculars is a good investment .

What are they like now.\n"," They were pretty bah some are really good  depends you can pay for um basic ones or you can get some um really good ones there's some great ones there but we usually take all our bikes because we've got our bikes  with the bike seat 'n' the trailer we've got a trailer for the kids get a get puffed they go on the trailer 'n' so   going up hills with a kid on the back is pretty hard good for your legs Harvey  my legs have really  gotta keep at it now it was just wonderful and my um little niece went 'n' she learnt to ride her bike there 'n' that was hilarious that was source of many laughs  because she um did some funny things like started  peddling uphill went dow around went nyaoo \n"," Oh dear.

I like your probrem program and not just the program but the station I'm addicted to.\n",".\n"," You've just about  I reckon you've just about won yourself a Solvol citrus soap pack  without opening your .\n"," Without even trying . Well done . How can we help your olive tree.\n"," Oh well I'm I've got a olive tree which is home grown from a a pip. It's okay growing and now have a fruit but when the olives start ripening get uh black from the tip up. Then start rotting from the tip up and have fall they off.\n"," Weh it's rots does it.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Has is it happen every year or is it just this year.\n"," Well uh I notice last year um before a it just l it had little bit and I  didn't notice much but last year's had plenty and this year the same. And it .\n"," Do they split Alexandra do they split and then start rotting.\n"," Uh some of them split afterwards they  but really without splitting they start rotting they rot.\n"," They start rotting anyway. When they start splitting they can they get um odemia . And when they start rotting they split and then so then the um rot sets in from the bottom and away it goes it just goes downhill from there . I would that's just aside from the ones that start rotting anyway what's the fruit like. Uh is it is it edible fruit.\n"," Oh they are beautiful to eat them when they  not affected you know.\n"," Sure what I would do then Alexandra when the olives are just starting to um size up when I say get to the right size I'd be spraying them with Mancozeb Plus fungicide unfortunately  you have to spray the tree  there's nothing we can do about that.\n"," Still green or when they black.\n"," Yeah while they're still green before they go black  because if they stay on for long enough while they're still green we're going to have to do that to stop it spreading. And you may need to apply it twice you may need to do it when they're just starting to form the right size  and then as theh just before they start to colour so you'd be looking at probably end of March and the mih ih no probably earlier than that middle of March 'n' the end of March . Time to spray with Mancozeb Plus.\n"," Mancozeb Plus.\n"," Yep see how you go with that.\n"," Alright okay thanks very much Alexandra and we weren't kidding you've won yourself a Solvol citrus soap pack so would you like to hang on the line  and we'll put you back to grumpy.\n"," Thanks very much  I never won anything in my life.\n"," Uh  well well done you have now.\n"," Well you've won something now isn't that good.\n"," Thank you.\n"," 'N' that  might lead to you winning Lotto tonight even Alexandra.\n"," Ah I don't doubt that.\n"," Well  I'll go you halves how about that.\n"," Thanks.\n"," Okay there we go alright uh we'll take a break it is thirteen minutes past eight.\n","\n","\n"," Yes I feel like a leak at the moment. Do you mind  me saying that yeah . So I thought what we would do is find out a little bit about 'em . C Christine joins us Christine Simpson from Fresh Finesse hello Christine.\n"," That one's a little bit hard to top I have to say  Harvey good morning Harvey 'n' Sue.\n"," Hi Christine . Well there is .\n"," What's the difference between an onion and a leek girls.\n",".\n"," What.\n"," I said I like leeks because I've have a lot of trouble when I'm cutting up onions they make me cry whereas leeks uh still have a lovely mild onion flavour but uh no tears.\n"," Now  listen can sorry can  I just butt in there for a moment.\n"," Certainly .\n"," I've got a solution for you Christine.\n"," Ih what's that Harvey.\n"," You need to go down and see our good mate Patrick at W A hospital supplies and ask him for a Zyliss chop chop.\n"," Ah yes yes.\n"," They are brilliant  I use mine all the time.\n"," Mine is virtually on the kitchen bench every day  because there's something to chop up whether it's garlic or oh Georgia's garlic by the way again  digressing ah put that in something the other day can't remember what um it yeah so y you you'll get no tears.\n"," Uh uh I think I might've had one of those at one stage is it um uh is it electric or.\n"," No no no.\n"," No  no you hand one.\n"," Yeah.\n"," I the problem with me Harvey is that I only have to look at an onion  and they make me cry .\n"," Oh no guarantee.\n"," I don't even get to peel it .\n"," What you do is it's it's it's sort of like a it's about ahr I suppose uh eight nine inches  high  and it's got a pump action and the thing is that you punch down these cutters and so what you do you put the whole thing over the onion w you don't put oh over a whole onion probably I'd cut mine up into about four pieces.\n"," 'Cos it gets stuck I've done that.\n"," 'Cos it gets stuck yeah 'n' I've done that many time  so you cut it into about four and just  get the uh dooverlackie on it 'n' go   it makes a helluva the duh uh c Harry the cat he fair dinkum nearly hits the roof 'cos he's sorta sleeping most of the time  and when he's not being naughty and so I think this is really good I'm gunna enjoy this now bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and and he jumps hits the roof the onion gets cut 'n' everyone gets on with their lives .\n"," And you a smile on your face.\n"," Oh I have to say  it's probably a a better idea than trying to cut onions by hand.\n"," Yeah well go 'n' see Patrick he'll  he'll do a good deal for you.\n"," We were talking about leeks the flavour of leeks is so much milder that it doesn't you can you can eat them um they don't overpower dishes do they.\n"," I think I think that's the advantih another advantage Sue actually and I particularly like to to slow cook them with or caramelise them with a little bit of you can use brown sugar or honey and either some olive oil or batter just in a lovely y'know get one of those nice Le Creuset pots from Patrick I suggest  just the thing for caramelised onh.\n"," Patrick give us the price we'll all have one.\n"," What's that Harvey.\n"," I say we'll geh Patrick'll probably give us a call 'n' give us a price we can all buy one.\n"," Yes well we could we could go buh go halves thirds ah .\n"," 'T's a good idea.\n"," And uh I like to once they're all lovely and soft and caramelised and and still uh with that mild onion aroma and then and while they're still warm add some olives and some roasted or semi-dried tomatoes and some thyme-flavoured vin vinaigrette so use fresh thyme it's so lovely at this  this  time of year.\n"," Mhm.\n"," Time for thyme.\n"," And.\n"," I kept saying to my sister I need some thyme and she's going  huh  she thought I meant normal time.\n"," Need  some of that too Sue.\n"," Yeah.\n"," And.\n"," I've had that conversation recently  yeah please continue.\n"," And if you want to turn that into a l a lovely warm potato salad just fold it  through some nice Delaware potatoes are really good at the moment um and just steam still with their skins on nice and chunky and that makes a lovely salad to serve with roasts and grills 'cos it's really it's really winter salad time I think at the moment. Now lemon trees are .\n"," Ah there's so many er lemons around.\n"," Except mine of course Sue  but I'll have to talk to you another time about that uh dripping with lemons. And so it's lovely to start the day with a glass of freshly squeezed lemon juice and I like to make preserved lemons for I'm going through a bit of a m Middle Eastern North African d cooking phase at the moment.\n"," Oh I haven't had that yet.\n"," Well I keep seeing recipes I've got a recipe for this and I keep saying I must make those.\n"," I get to  Moroccan lamb and that's about as far as I've got .\n"," Takes five minutes to do the preserved lemon.\n"," Does it.\n"," Yes.\n"," What do you do.\n"," Ah that's one for me.\n"," So and  so two or three or however many you think you're going to need just wash 'n' dry them evenly shaped ones are a good thing and I've the easiest way I think is to cut off both ends  stand it up uh so it's up 'n' down on the bench and just cut it half way through not oh sorry h about three quarters of the way down not all the way through just in half and then turn it to ninety degrees and turn it over and cut it the other way so it's still whole but you've broken it into almost into quarters . Pack the inside of each of all wherever you can with just ordinary cooking salt pack it into a jar and you can do one lemon or you can do ten or however many and then fill the jar with freshly squeezed lemon juice . And if you leave that for about three weeks you're on the way to Moroccan lamb or chicken or whatever you like Harvey  and it'll keep um for months in the fridge.\n"," 'T's a good idea.\n"," Tt oh that's fantastic . Now I've also read Christine you can't use um well you need thin-skin lemons or it doesn't matter. Does it matter if you use  Ruic  lemons. Yeah.\n"," We call them Meyer lemons by the way.\n"," Yeah Meyer lemons.\n"," Oh yes  I do too that's what my tree is  um  I do know that much .\n"," No no no the surprise is that I do .\n"," Actually that's.\n"," I'm very impressed Harvey.\n"," That's interesting speaking of thick skins Harvey because  I read during the week that the the thick-skinned len lemons are best for preserving because  you only use the skin you the you'd actually discard the pulp and the salty liquid and you wash all that off the skin and then just use that  the preserved skin.\n"," That's why I've been hesitant of of doing them because it says thin skins is best on my recipe book so I'm gunna change that  I'm gunna head down 'n'  'n' do it tomorrow yeah  can use I sure can.\n"," Which I think are the ones that are plentiful at the moment  and uh preserved lemons are just gorgeous with couscous uh  salads through summer  and also vegie or lamb or chicken tagines any of that  um.\n"," Wonderful stuff.\n"," And even great with pasta.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Now you've got all this info on your website too haven't you W W W dot fresh F F R E S H F dot com dot A U.\n"," Dot com dot A U we certainly will from early in the week Harvey .\n"," Good oh that's fantastic then uh.\n"," Now you've put me on a spot.\n"," No that's alright I mean duh it's good to have a bit of a shoofty through your  site anyway 'cos there's lots of good stuff on it.\n"," It is yes we try to keep up to date and our recipes are seasonal and our product information too so you can get a pretty good idea of what to cook with what's in season.\n"," Marvellous alright Christine great to talk to you this morning we'll do it again next week.\n"," Thanks Harvey.\n"," You've inspired us all again.\n"," Thanks Christine.\n"," Christine Simpson from Fresh Finesse it's uh twenty-four minutes past eight   I think we're gunna talk to Anne of Mt Hawthorn in a second  I think we might have a little special treat coming our way at eight-thirty.\n"," Do you.\n"," Yes I'm not gunna tell you what it is yet  see if you can remember. We were promised something last week and it might happen. Anne of Mt Hawthorn hello Anne.\n"," Yes  good morning Harvey uh good morning Sue. Sue I've got a couple of questions the first one is we have got a ponytail and my husband wants to like cut trim it right back and do an X so we'll see if we can get four shoots.\n"," Your husband can do that that's no problem at all.\n"," Can we do that now.\n"," Yeah  can you wait a month.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Yeah if you wait a month it's just in the warm weather that's all  it's just the warmer the better now it doesn't really matter you can do four an X at the top of the stem and they will shoot away but not guaranteed where it's going to shoot.\n"," Okay.\n"," It might not shoot exactly where it's been cut. It might shoot a v little bit below  so could be two shoots on one side four on one side it just  depends but wherever there's a dormant bud sorry a leaf there's a dormant bud a leaf scar that's underneath so go for it Anne you'll find a beautiful big bushy plant rather than a.\n"," Yeah it is looking a bit  bit lean and mean.\n"," Yeah they do they do tend to get like that so I always think just chop them off they'll be much better.\n"," Okay great and the next question Sue I've got um a beautiful navel orange tree which we had heaps of fruit on . Um we had a couple of oranges that had like um some soft spots on.\n"," Well you need to get onto that that's bah a bacterial rot that the oranges get  and and.\n"," A couple of them went bad  like on the tree.\n"," Yeah and they go on the tree I would spray it with Mancozeb Plus now  as a fung just to kih clean up and kill any spores if some of them go on the tree 'n' hang on the tree just cut them off 'n' discard those . Any that have fallen on the ground 'n' have gone rotten you need to pick those up as well.\n"," Yeah well we've finished the whole fruit's finished now.\n"," Beautiful are there any hanging on the tree like  munnif mummified okay just give them give it a it's not going to hurt to give it a cover spray now.\n"," Yeah can we.\n"," With Mancozeb Plus  if you need to give it a trim back do all that  then as soon as the fruit sets for next year 'n' it's just starting to colour is the time we need to spray at.\n"," Yeah to give it a trim back Sue what do we do just cut the deadwood off or give it  a good trim or.\n"," Cut any deadwood off you lyh ooh cut that out completely  and then the branches if they're outta control reduce those you can reduce it up to a third if you want to Anne  need to get onto it now before the new growth comes the new growth is what the is the fruit bearing wood  for next year.\n"," What's the best fertiliser to use.\n"," Uh use a complete citrus fertiliser that is um you can get one that's organic-based and you apply that every four to six weeks through the growing season 'n' the growing season for citrus trees is from August to May.\n"," Okay good on you thanks very much indeed Anne it's twenty-seven past eight.\n","\n","\n"," And your tree's grown okay it's interesting we've just had an email from Kevin uh \n"," Mhm I had a look at the photos Kevin 'n' we can fix that. So good to see the photo uh at the same time because there's a saucer underneath that tr that uh pot it needs to um be removed from the saucer and looking at the the size of the pot 'n' size of mandarin tree I'd actually zip out 'n' get a bigger pot for it put it into fresh tub 'n' terracotta potting mix lift it up off the ground so it's not sitting in a saucer of water continually and you'll find your mandarin tree will just bolt away citrus fertiliser  do those things 'n' it will just take off the you can see um in the pot the soil has sunk away from the um top of the pot we need some more soil in there so a bigger pot your mandarin tree looks beautiful and healthy it just hasn't grown so we need some more room in it for the root system.\n"," So we could've asked Len those questions  'n' he would've said my experience is probably woulda said the same as you did.\n"," He wuh ih would've done because he's now expert on mandarin trees and lemon trees by the sounds of it.\n"," By the sound of it  I'm gunna be an expert on eating one of those mandarins very soon.\n"," Me too.\n"," Mm okay  well uh.\n"," I don't know how I'll do it when I answer questions so you have one first .\n"," Alright Maureen of Watermans Bay hello Maureen.\n"," Hi Maureen.\n",".\n"," Hello.\n"," I think she walked  away .\n"," When I'm calling you.\n"," Oh no I had it on speaker sorry.\n"," That's okay.\n"," Um yeah I just wanted to check um just a couple of things um the slaters in the lawn. Um I was just weeding the other day and they're everywhere in the lawn. Um apart from using those little pellet things 'n' I'm a bit worried about my grandson.\n"," Sure.\n"," Um wuh what could we use.\n"," Do you leave the lawn clippings on the lawn when you is there a lotta thatch on the lawn.\n"," No well I get a  we get a mow an um yeah we get a lawnmower  contractor to do it but  he takes it away.\n"," Is it couch lawn Maureen.\n"," Um it's um uh   um suh uh something S what's it um.\n"," Saltine.\n"," Yeah  saltine.\n"," And how old is your lawn.\n"," Oh about four four and a half years old.\n"," Few things you can do there's not a lot of h   a slater's job is to break down dead 'n' decaying matter so if there's a lot of old thatch there the slater finds a beautiful home and the slater will f slaters think that's just wonderful spot to be so   if there's a food source there the slaters are there . There's not a lotta things that you can do to the only thing you can do is put a few pellets in saucers around when your grandson sorta come just overnight let the slaters like they're feeding stations for them let the slaters um be attracted to them to reduce the population and pick them up in the morning. I hate doing that hate having pellets around the other thing that you can do at the beginning of September is vertimow your lawn now the moh lawn's gunna look awful for a few weeks but it will shoot away beautifully and it will also reduce all that thatch and it will reduce the home for the slaters there'll be no food source there so they'll disappear.\n"," Suh so if I l if I left the slaters is it damaging the lawn at all or.\n"," Not really  only if they bih in plague proportions  their job is to break down dead and decaying matter it's only they get tender new seedlings when you've planted beautiful new seedlings in in the garden but a f a lawn can cope with slaters.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Um juh just a couple cuh other cuh goh have I got time for a couple of other quick ones.\n"," Certainly.\n"," Um the other one was the clover we've got that purple clover which is going mad ih it's only a lih we've only got a small little lawn because we're near the coast um sort of where I'm talking the front lawn seems to be alright 'cos it's a different lawn completely . But we've got this purply kind of clover through .\n"," With the yellow flower that's that's a type of oxalis and it is awful it's just awful to get rid of.\n"," Well yeah it seems to be and it was  lih little bit last year 'n' it seems to be twice as bad this year.\n"," Yeah and it'll be four times as worse next year. Maureen you need to use a broadleaf weed killer on it to knock it around a selective broadleaf weed killer for that's suitable for lawns for couch lawns  or pull it out by hand there's no other choice.\n"," Oh okay well I  sort of did that last year  a little bit but I mean this year  it's going to be a  even though it's a small juh I mean it's a small lawn area I could probably do it but  it's still a job and a half.\n"," Yeah that's right  yeah so it's up to you if you wanted to spray it to reduce to knock it on the head and stop those seed heads um setting fertile seeds for next year  because if you get the seeds once they've flowered and then they've got the little seed head they just ping and they just spread everywhere. And that purple-leaf oxalis is the is really hard to get rid of.\n"," Mm  it's even hard to pull up.\n"," Uh terrible  terrible so yeah I don't f  I do do  feel sorry for you yep.\n"," Oh that's good . Um just one other quick one I know you're you're busy um we've actually got two big lemon trees now we're right um not lemon olive trees  we're right on the coast and they're massive like the trunks are sort of uh we're only been here four and a half years and the trunks are sort of like the size of a plate.\n"," Really.\n"," Um but they got so big we need to prune them back  but we normally like to do it after winter because  they get knocked around a bit  in the wind . Um is that okay in spring.\n"," Yeah no problem at all  spring is fine . Yeah you can  you can you can pollard them what we call pollard them so they get chopped back really hard what you'll find happens in um the olive grown reeh growing regions is uh after the immediately after the last lot of fruit is gone they get chopped back really hard. The problem that happens with um being next to the coast that new growth gets ih damaged. What you'll find if you trim them back after the beginning of um sorry at the beginning of spring that's when the flowers 'n' the fruit come so if you don't mind losing some flowers 'n' fruit cut them back really hard but if you do mind losing some flowers 'n' fruit you're just going to have to prune them back   a little bit this year s and the rest next year so you're reducing the plant for this year letting new growth come you'll get half the amount of fruit and do the same thing for next year but to pollard them you can chop them back at ground level and they'll still shoot away beautifully.\n"," Pardon me  excuse me that's um not a direct result thanks eev uh thanks by the way uh Maureen um that's not a direct result of eating a mandarin that is beautiful what I've just had  beautiful sweet yeah.\n"," Ah can't wait  to have one I love mandarins.\n"," Be careful 'cos the juice'll go everywhere that's how nice they are . Okay Yvonne of Leeming g'day Yvonne.\n"," Hi how you going.\n"," Good.\n"," Fantastic.\n"," Uhuh so I have a question about my azaleas um we've got thirty-odd bushes around the house flowering beautifully but a lot of the bushes the leaves are starting to go yellow and dropping off. Um I read somewhere where um it could be a lack of something in the soil 'n'  throwing blood 'n' bone around might  help it. Is that possibly what it is.\n"," Is it the older leaves Yvonne.\n"," Sorry.\n"," Older leaves doing it.\n"," Um yes they are probably.\n"," Yeah. If it's the older leaves doing going yellow with no green veins usually it says there's a lack of nitrogen so throwing blood 'n' bone around's going to help so so you need to add some nitrogen some nutrients 'n' they'll pick that up 'n' green up straight away. Few other things that can happen if your soil is very alkaline your nutrients are tied up in the soil and aren't available to the plant so they're locked away chemically . And when they're locked away then the um nutrients then then not available if the P H is very alkaline ush but usually shows up green veins on the azalea leaves so that's iron deficiency a little bit of green veining um on the older leaves the other thing that can happen is just check the underneath the leaves to see if there's no silvering no blacking blackening so you got black spots on the leaves and also a rusty colour so that it looks like the leaves have been damaged . Grab grab a piece of paper flick the leaves onto a blank piece of paper  and see if you can shee  any thrip  insects they also cause silvering 'n' yellowing on the top of the leaves as well.\n"," Okay and can we get the soil tested or do you buy a soil test .\n"," Certainly you can get the soil tested gotta zip down to your local garden centre 'n' they'll more than happy to test it for you  but not for nutrients only for P H so s.\n"," Alright and if we throw the blood 'n' bone around  or if can we do that now or  do we have to wait.\n"," It's not going to hurt anything  at all  you'll find that the um blood 'n' bone the only thing that happens with blood 'n' bone is that it's going to give you leaf growth so you know how you get the flowers of the azaleas that are beautiful on the top all you see is um azalea flowers and no leaves  you'll find that ih they encourage flowering sorry feeding them at flowering time is going to push the new growth past those flowers . So up to you whether you even wait a few weeks once the flowers are finished.\n"," Thank you very much indeed Yvonne it's eighteen minutes to nine and uh actually uh are you still there Yvonne. Yvonne's gone muh. That was Yvonne wasn't it.\n"," Yep.\n"," Yeah  okay. Okay um Angelo of Spearwood g'day Angelo.\n"," Yeah how you going guys.\n"," Fantastic.\n"," Good.\n"," I'm just calling in regards we've got a lemon tree and it's y'know it's a bit it's a pretty good lemon tree but it makes lemons where they're .\n",".\n"," Like there's no juice in 'em.\n"," They're dry are they.\n"," Yeah  they're pretty dry.\n"," Are they thick skin.\n"," They are very  thick skin . Um we do get like a little bit of like a spotty around 'em.\n"," Yep.\n"," Um but other than that they're just you open 'em up 'n' they're y'know they're all very thick skin you can cut a little  bit of juice in the middle.\n"," What do you feed them with Angelo.\n"," Ah we just put a bit of chicken manure 'n'  just water.\n"," Yeah okay. Those ones that are really monsters are they close to the inside of the tree the lemons and they've been hanging around  sort of for a long time.\n"," No they're all over the place  it's all throughout the tree  we have we have cut the tree back y'know a couple of years ago  or maybe even more twelve  about twelve months ago  but um yeah just ih it just does these and ih they're not some of them aren't round some of them are look like they got uh uh y'know one on one on top of the other  y'know what I mean.\n"," Yeah now few things that you've got there. How much water does your lemon tree get.\n"," We give heaps.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Dad's y'know my dad just pours it with water because he y'know uh uh.\n"," He wants big lemons  he wants juicy lemons yes.\n"," He wants juicy ones.\n"," Sure  now ch  chook whih what's what's the use of having lemon tree when there's no lemon no juice. Chook manure is going to give you really thick skin because it's high nitrogen we're going t  he's going to have to feed it uh with a complete citrus fertiliser so that's the most important thing. If you've got chook manure it goes straight to the skin forgets about the pulp. You'll find if you give it a complete fertiliser with potassium and phosphorus and iron and copper and zinc and molybdemul  all those nutrients that the plant needs they're going to be taken up in little bits. But if it's just nitrogen you get beautiful big green leaves and really thick skin. Eureka lemon is a little bit prone to it. If it's the older lemons that have been hanging on the tree they've gone through summer 'n' they've been hanging on the tree as well they do tend to stay dry 'n' that's the reason I asked if it's the ones right inside the tree sometimes that happens as well. The other problem you've got is bud mite if you've got one lemon on top of another so they're all joined together in really funny shapes that's a bud mite that little mite gets in and causes damage of the cells and the skin and it all ends up really ah it's the most amazing shapes come out of it but it does demun damage the plant so tt uh when it's flowering this year when it's got that beautiful new spring flowering on it which'd be October November we need to the next lot of flowering we need to then spray it with you can either use pest oil which is which will h help the mites or you need to use a miticide like Maverick and that's going to clear that up. Start a program from August to May so from this week on giving a little bit of complete citrus fertiliser you can give it the chicken manure at the same time Angelo but just give it the complete citrus fertiliser as well and you sure that will make a huge difference.\n"," Alright Angelo.\n"," Okay beautiful thank you very much.\n"," Pleasure Angelo keep the water up to it.\n"," No worries can I just ask one little question.\n"," Certainly.\n"," Okay I've got a mandarin tree  which used to fruit fantastically . Last two years I haven't seen one mandarin .\n"," It's not rootstock that's taken over is it.\n"," No no it's just decided to go on strike but it looks  good.\n"," It looks good does it. Does that  get lots of nitrogen too does it get lots of  chook manure.\n"," Yes it does .\n"," Okay cut the chook manure back to that and give it some citrus fertiliser as well 'cos we need to get the flowers and if it looks good that's the not a good thing usually the crappiest-looking mandarin trees give the best fruit.\n"," Well I tell you what this thing looks like a good plant y'know but  it's just not given us any mandarins.\n"," Yeah we need the flowers we need something that's going to encourage the flowers but check to make sure that there's no shoots nothing that's shot below the graft too Angelo.\n"," Okay  no problems . Thank you very much .\n"," No Angelo Angelo Angelo I'm gunna put you back to grumpy 'cos you've won yourself a forty-five dollar Solvol citrus soap pack.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Our  pleasure Angelo enjoy it.\n"," Good on you Angelo  it's thirteen to nine.\n","\n","\n"," Eleven minutes to nine and was I right about Len's mandarins.\n"," They are superb Len  they are the best Emperor mandarins I've ever tasted.\n"," Really.\n"," Yep. I I would they're the juiciest  the sweetest usually they tend to be a bit uh bland I think tastes  I really like the  Imperial mandarins but they they are superb Len you are a star thank you.\n"," What a genius  okay let's go to Ron of Bentley g'day Ron.\n"," Hey good morning Harvey good morning Sue. I've got a a ponytail 'n' I had t had to transplant it from a broken earthenware pot 'cos it got too big  into a half a wine barrel . But I put the potting mix on the bottom then I put a f a full bag of uh cow sheep 'n' um chook manure in the bottom y'know  on top of that. Then I put another bag of potting mix 'n' I put  the ponytail 'n' me wife said ah you're gunna kill it.\n"," Yeah you'll probably cause it to rot Ron.\n"," Ah.\n"," Um ideally it woulda been best to have just straight potting mix in there.\n"," Oh okay.\n"," What you'll find is the cow sh isn't it terrible when when someone else is right in the family\n"," Yeah .\n"," Um .\n"," Yeah she said take it out so I gotta take it out 'n' take it out don't I.\n"," I would yeah  uh the reason the reason is is um tt ponytails are succulents they do cope with very harsh conditions anyway they're a type of succulent so they they they need very free draining soil. In  the ground you'd be able to put a little bit of sheep manure or soil improver in the ground 'n' that wouldn't hur wouldn't hurt at all but in a wine barrel even though the wood absorbs moisture tt 'n' it drains freely in a wine barrel it's best to have just straight potting mix in there  so it drains you find that you'll you'll kill it with kindness more so than anything.\n"," So when she comes home I have to tell her she was right.\n"," Yeah well well you  maybe just don't even tell her. Just do it.\n"," Yeah I I'll go  'n' do it now.\n"," Yeah .\n"," Okay .\n"," You'll get reminded though that you weren't right and she was  it'll happen even no matter how you try to.\n"," Marh I'm impressed because Ron admitted it so  yeah I know these things happen but  that's okay 'cos I think I think we should ease your pain Ron we'll give you a um Solvol citrus pack valued at forty-five dollars 'n' that's got Solvol citrus pump pack citrus bar 'n' hand towel cyclone hand cultivator and hand trowel.\n"," Ah thank you.\n"," Mm.\n"," I'll put you back to grumpy 'n' he can organise it for you Ronnie.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Thanks mate  okay we'll go to Claire now of Wembley Downs.\n"," Hi Claire.\n"," Oh hello. I was just wondering um Sue if you remember the product you were talking about that was very good for putting down the drain.\n"," I do I do. The best thing to use is copper sulfate there's a lot of brands around  of different things but if you just get cuppus copper sulfate. Copper sulfate will half a cuppa copper sulfate down your sink or flush it in the toilet  whatever once a month copper sulfate just burns the roots the fine feeder roots there so  it will stop stop any um roots tt getting into into um into your drains it works as a really good preventative.\n"," And that's good  for putting uh for uh the mould off brick paving  as well.\n"," It is but in light-colour brick paving if you use copper sulfate straight it will it'll turn a tinge blue so you do need to mix it with water 'n' scrub it. The other thing copper sulfate's really good for if you've got a gravel pathway tt uh any any spots of gravel 'n' you've got pots on the ground 'n' you don't want them to root into um send their roots through the pots onto the paving or also onto the onto the gravel if you've got some gravel around if you spray that with copper sulfate  that will stop that happening as well  regularly it works really well just be careful with copper sulfate on tt soft leaf plants if you've got native violet or baby's tears of anything like that around it will burn it . It will cause a problem.\n"," Alright 'n' can I ask you just one other qu question.\n"," Certainly.\n"," Sorry it's just that we have um four um of oh what d'ya call the uh mm oh heavens now I can't remember what they're called they're the pines the pencil pines  and they're we've just got a group of four separating  our house to next door's and there's just the second one along has decided to die 'n'  halfway down  it has died and I think it might get into the others  I'm wondering what we should do about it.\n"," Uh  when did it die when did you start  to notice it.\n"," Just our neighbours just said about a few weeks ago 'n' she said have you noticed our pine and I hadn't and I looked up  'n' I've just noticed now that it's getting further  and further down  for the last two months.\n"," Ah Claire pines conifers take a long while to die so that could've been damage that's happened a long time ago so it's not probably anything that you've done recently . But if it's died say halfway down 'n' it dies have a look at the trunk make sure there's no borers in there tt  have a look right at the base there's no blackening of the stem no oozing of gum or sap to make sure it's not Ceridium fungus or conifer canker they are susceptible to canker  and there's really no known cure for conifer canker it's to stop the plant stressing you need to keep the water up to them keep the um insects off them keep them well fed and so they don't stress because usually Ceridium fungus comes about becuh as a secondary infection from insect borer or or bark weevil or something like that so we need to   we need to make sure there's no insects on it the other thing you can do is spray it with anti-rot there's a product out called um Yates Anti Rot which is or Phosject which is now the active constituent of those two is phosphoric acid now it's not registered for it but it it works as a preventative you can either spray it to a point of runoff or inject the tree. See how you go with that but make sure but the indicators of um Ceridium fungus is blackening of the stem die back of tops of certain branches and gum oozing sap oozing from the trunk.\n"," Thank you very much Claire and I think before the break and uh thus the news we'll go to Len of Gosnells hello Len.\n"," Good  morning Sue and Harvey  how are you.\n"," Fantastic.\n"," Um I have a uh and I say I 'cos it was a uh a Christmas gift uh from my wife an old English mulberry tree.\n"," Oh you lucky thing.\n"," Now it's three years old it's actually  four years old but it's only been in the ground three years . And uh it I trimmed it back two years ago 'n' obviously it hasn't fruited so  I wanna trim it so it g with the hope that it grows 'n' grows 'n' grows 'cos it's it is doing well but this year we'd like mulberries on it.\n"," Don't trim it back till after yih it's fruited then.\n"," Okay.\n"," That's the key. Otherwise you'll you'll loose it old English mulberry tree tends to not tends to not um grow you don't have to prune it back really hard um they don't grow really long canes the Hicks fancy does grows really long canes 'n' grows outta control but the black English mulberry's very slow-growing. So you'll find the the depending   black English mulberry will fruit in January just after Christmas is when they fruit   prune it then then its new growth comes on and they always hide under the leaves of course as you know  so if you prune it after it's finished fruiting you will not chop the mulberries off and away you go.\n"," Okay 'cos it's  I mean it's just a mess of branches ih higgledy-piggledy everywhere.\n"," Yeah they're a lovely tree  they are lovely tree yeah my favourite.\n"," Okay good on you Len thank you very much indeed for your query about the uh mulberry tree uh we're just about through the first hour so what we'll do is take a break have another mandarin I think  would be in order  another mandarin each and uh then uh Lennie's got the news coming up he of the mandarin tree  and after the news second hour of our Saturday Garden Party nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is the number to call.\n","\n","\n"," Thank you Len and thank you for the mandarins they are absolutely magnificent.\n"," They are.\n"," No doubt about that .\n"," They are there's not many left .\n"," Grumpy's got some I'm I should give a cuh I will I'll give a couple to George because he was  good enough to bring that garlic in.\n"," Exactly right  we'll swap him. We gave him a prezzie last week wasn't it.\n"," Did we.\n"," Yeah the little purple  the purple Neopet   I'm sure he was  impressed with that not .\n"," No that's fuh that's actually.\n"," Oh he didn't take it home damn .\n"," That's turned up somewhere I don't know where it is.\n"," Oh did it someone else got it as a  present .\n"," I thought it was still in here somewhere . It was here.\n"," I actually just appeared from here so I actually don't even know whose it was.\n"," I don't think George is into purple Neopets.\n"," Oh don't you think so.\n"," Strangely enough yeah.\n"," Strange that. True.\n"," We'll talk to George about his show coming up after ten o'clock Saturday Morning at the Football a bit later on in the meantime nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is our telephone number or if you've got ah um an email to send us then   please do look we should oh dear. Oh goodness gracious me I've got some photos to show you we'll get to Glenys of Balga in a moment. Good morning Sue says Kevin um   now wait on have I done that.\n"," Done the mandarin one  fr that was from Kevin.\n"," Yeah suh I know there's an unhappy  puh oh yeah the unhappy plant one.\n"," The unhappy happy plant.\n"," Oh dear. Here we go \n"," Yep seen those and yes you can cut your hibiscus back but it's best to cut the hibiscus back at the beginning of September as it warms up it uh will be better and the unhappy happy plant that strip you've got just cut it into sections that looks like quite a large bit that's been chopped off so cut it into sections about eighteen inches forty centimetres long and cut into the bottom bark with the sharp blade of your secateurs paint it with hormone gel and put it into a good quality potting mix if put in good quality potting mix put five or six branches in one pot strip all the bottom leaves off the top branch will need to have the leaves chopped in half so trip  all those awful leaves need to be chopped away put it somewhere where it's nice and warm if your new pergola is in a position where it's gets the morning sun that is fantastic for those cuttings they'll shoot away   ideally not the best time to grow cuttings for happy plants because it needs warm weather but sometimes these things happen you just make the most of the situation you're in.\n"," Indeed you do. Okey dokey now 'tis time to say good morning to our good friend Glenys of Balga hi Glen.\n"," Hi Glenyn .\n"," Good morning you happy people . And um I wanna talk to you Sue about Swan River daisies.\n"," What would you like to know.\n"," Well I'm are you have you moved away from the microphone Sue 'cos it doesn't sound as loud.\n"," No.\n"," Okay. Um   I'm growing some in a seed tray  and I know it's a bit early  but I've got them in a mini greenhouse  now it says to move them when they're three or four centimetres high . Now do you think I should move them into pots or do you think it might be alright to put them out in the garden or is it still too early to do that.\n"," I would go   the situation they're going in Glenys is it a really warm is it protected position no bugs as far as slaters or or snails or anything.\n"," Huh slaters you must be joking.\n"," Well then put 'em in pots until they're a bit bigger then.\n"," Ah 'cos they'll  love to eat them.\n"," Because they're nice 'n' soft if you've got zillions of slaters they'll just get into them straight away. They tend they they're not supposed to but they will because they're beautiful and soft so  how tall are they now.\n"," Oh um well they've just broken through so they're like  one centimetre or something.\n"," They'll be probably three weeks time transplant them  into separate pot even just little separate tubes or hundred mil what we call hundred mil pots so  sorta ten centimetre pots and then by the end of September away out they go.\n"," Okay.\n"," Even probably before then 'cos they're gunna grow r so quick.\n"," Are they.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Oh great  'cos I I saw them en masse up at Kings Park at the  Wildflower. Oh they look fabulous.\n"," They do.\n"," 'N' I've  been dying to have them ever since.\n"," Yeah good on you . Well done.\n"," Okay thank you very much.\n"," Thanks so much lovely  to talk to you Glenys bye-bye.\n"," Thank you Glenys now to Thornlie   good morning Judy.\n"," Hi good morning.\n"," Hi Judy.\n"," Hello. Um look I'm just ringing up to ask you I've got a um can um um   campilian  rose.\n"," Chameleon.\n"," Is it it's the little one that comes  out 'n' changes colour.\n"," It's a gorgeous rose.\n"," Yes that's correct  um I've had it in a pot for about four years  and I want to transplant it they I've heard they go better in a terracotta pot.\n"," They do do better in terracotta is it in a plastic pot now Judy.\n"," Um   no it's in a glazed pot.\n"," Yep   the.\n"," So how do I go about .\n"," The reason that they do better in terracotta terracotta breathes . Okay now that's really the only reason up off the ground it drains freely but if you don't want to have it in terracotta pot if it's in a glazed pot 'n' doing beautifully that is fine  as long as it's up off the ground 'n' it's draining freely.\n"," I see yes  it's doing that I just thought it'd been in there for two year  uh four years so I thought I'd um.\n"," Change it ba have you pruned it yet.\n"," No no it's just come out in flower.\n"," Again that'd be right.\n"," Uh yes  and um I'm just waiting for it to die off 'n' then I'll cut it back 'n' change  it over . Um so how do I go about I've got this .\n"," Uh what you need is quality tub 'n' terracotta potting mix . Tip it upside down get as much of the root system as possible you'll find that you can just pull some of the root system off  a little bit into the pot transplant into pot lots of tub 'n' terracotta potting mix around wash it in so it all packs down. The plant will not look back Judy the th the most important thing is s is to lift it up off the ground  so so that it drains freely don't put any rocks no bits of bark no charcoal nothing in the bottom of  the pot potting mixes are now designed to drain freely so.\n"," I see so  terracotta I don't have to get the rose uh potting mix.\n"," Tub 'n' terracotta potting mix will be beautiful  tub 'n' terracotta potting mix the best thing about it's got water storing granules 'n' wetting agent  added to it.\n"," And what el what was it called.\n"," Terracotta.\n"," Uh tub 'n' ceh terrapotta uh terracotta potting mix and  puh then do I 'n' when do I prune it before I put it in or afterward.\n"," Yeah prune it before you put it in I know there's probably some flowers on it but you need to prune it within the next few weeks there's probably flowers on it now but if you prune it in the next few weeks it will give you beautiful spring growth.\n"," You are gunna be very busy Judy so  guess what you've won a  you've won yourself a forty-five dollar Solvol citrus soap pack how about that.\n"," Oh very good thank you . And could I just ask do I have to paint the pot.\n"," No uh well up to you you can  paint the poh.\n"," Uh T V last night where  they're painting the inside of the pot.\n"," Yeah they do with a sealer  now there's a product out that Yates put out called Pot-Seal  and the reason we do that is to stop the evaporation stop the mois the plants drying out so quickly  the pots drying out so quickly  so if you've got your rose in a full sun position that'll make a big difference.\n"," Alright Judy.\n"," Oh yes I'll go to Bunnings and buy that  okay and um I just wanted to .\n"," Judy we're gunna change our mind about giving you a prize if you don't get off.\n"," Okay .\n"," Harvey you nasty basty .\n"," Just keep going Judy you're on a roll.\n"," it's okay.\n"," Thank you very much.\n"," No d'you wanna ask something else I was only  kidding yeah.\n"," I just planted some avenue lavender last October  how long does that take to flower.\n"," That should flower this ss three weeks time about four  weeks time avenue lavender is a gorgeous hedging lavender.\n"," Oh great okay then  well it's a great show and thank you very much.\n"," Thanks Judy you're very welcome.\n"," You hang on the line Jude okay.\n"," yes.\n"," Duh don't go away.\n"," No fine thank you .\n"," Righto let's go to Mandurah hello Sue.\n"," Hi um.\n"," Hi Sue.\n"," Hi um I've got a ixoras I've got um about seven of 'em in pots  but they've started dying from the top but not all of 'em.\n"," Only some of them.\n"," Yeah.\n"," In pots.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Are there are some branches dying from the top on eah or one plant in one pot's dying from the top and the one next to it is fine.\n"," Um about three of 'em have died. Um one started dying from the top  'n' it had three branches so I cut the branch off that was dying . Now one of the other branches has started dying from the top.\n"," Oh not good news how long have they been in the same soil.\n"," Um we moved house probably about five months ago . So.\n"," Are they in terracotta plastic.\n"," No just the plastic ones.\n"," Have they got a saucer underneath.\n"," No. Some of them have been sitting on soil.\n"," Yeah. It may be just a drainage problem the water's not draining in away. Usually when a plant dies from the top there's a few reasons but but the main reasons are if it's dying from the top is either not enough water or too much water.\n"," Probably  too much.\n"," Yep I would say if they've been sitting on soil in a plastic pot with all the rain wuh okay July's been very dry but all the rain we've had extra water if you tip that plant upside down I'd say it's probably soggy at the bottom. Those fine feeder roots at the bottom just the water can't drain away lift them up off the ground you I would ruh be re-potting them Sue.\n"," Right okay um should I cut the dying bit off as well.\n"," Definitely definitely  yep put it in in a nice warm sunny position  but protected and the ixoras should shoot away soon as it warms up they should shoot away. The other thing that um affects ixoras uh is the cold weather but living in Mandurah I would not suspect it it's the cold weather if it's if you were living in the hills in or northern sort of east I'd be saying uh it could easily be the cold but in Mandurah it's um so much warmer.\n"," Yeah oh well I'll put it in my mini uh glasshouse type thing.\n"," Yep good idea.\n"," Okay now um I'm after some clivia seeds for the yellow one do you know where you can buy them.\n"," Have a look in grab Your Garden magazine or Burke's Backyard magazine have a look in the classified ads at the back  they uh sometimes have mail order clivia seeds.\n"," So you can't get 'em in West Australia.\n"," Not that I know of not seeds that I know of but I'm sure they are around but just not that I know of  so just if you got mail order from over east just give them a ring on Monday I mean if you get the magazine you'll be able to find them or someone will know someone who will be able to supply them for you . But often um Digger's Garden Club   um advertise in there give them a ring to start with otherwise the classifieds in the back of the magazine should be able to help you Sue . A query lucky bamboo.\n"," Yeah I've got it like groups of three . And just one of 'em's dying.\n"," Mm is it above the stem a little bit. Is it.\n"," Well it's going all the way down the  stem but the shoot is staying green.\n"," Yeah. You'll find that they get a Pythium fungus which is like a stem rot on them once  wuh at certain times I've had a couple of branches of one of mine do the same thing. It's just something that they are prone to because those those stems are very soft. The shoot on top is still fine but all the cells collapse along that stem they rot 'n' then they're just hollow there's nothing 'n' then a black mould goes around them actually  after um there's nothing you can do to reeh to get that one to recover. Pull it out um change the water and refresh refresh it up nice fresh water and then um just break the top shoot off and then put that back in some water . That's the only thing you can do once it's damaged like that   I think it's with mine it came about I changed the position I had it to a a position that was too cold. Needs to be in quite a warm light position and they do much better Sue.\n"," Good on you Sue thanks for your call it's sixteen past nine.\n","\n","\n"," Twenty minutes past nine Kim Hagdorn's arrived George Grljusich has arrived. We'd better give 'em a couple of mandarins keep 'em going  before their show Saturday Morning at the Footy coming up along with Ken Judge after ten o'clock. We get some very interesting letters don't we  we've got an absolute beauty this week.\n"," I love this one Harvey I had a  big laugh to myself can I read it out . Yeah okay. \n"," Double-dutch.\n"," Yeah that's right  \n"," \n"," I can't even tell what  what's meant to be silent  'n' not silent.\n"," Tuintip T T U I N  T I P what's  that mean.\n"," I think it must mean garden tip  because look at the front of the book  'n' it's tuint yeah there  is and  tuin tuintip  tuin agenda planner and  logboeh ih boek it's called . So that's funny  so we need to find someone who c .\n"," That'd be funny wouldn't it getting it home stick your glasses on 'n' go uhuh . What've I done.\n"," You need what go 'n' get new glasses . How do you n even know it's Dutch.\n"," Duh this is fruit well that's I can read that  that's that's the Dutch word for fruit uh \n"," Cringing .\n"," Well if anyone  speaks Dutch w d'you wanna d oh what're we  we gunna do with the book there's not much use for us.\n"," Who would like a gardening book well we'll give it to 'em  what do you think . 'Cos I know nobody  who speaks Dutch so there we go  but she's also looking for one that will help her . Garden Gurus  um the have written a couple of books Eva they may be able to help you go to any of the bookshops or garden centres they should be able to you should be able to find their books they're written for Western Australia find their books 'n' they will be able to help you with what you can plant now and for the rest of the year.\n"," Well there you go if you speak Dutch you've gone  and won yourself a book . Genevieve of Dianella's next.\n"," They need to speak it on on um so we can prove it.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Oh yeah . Becauh they gotta talk to us in Dutch  do you speak Dutch Genevieve.\n"," No I don't but if.\n"," Genevieve is a French name.\n"," If it was in French yes but Dutch no  out of my league>.\n"," No we haven't  got a French  gardening book.\n"," Through the holidays no we haven't but I've been ringih uh reading Almost French by Sarah Turnbull.\n"," Oh have you.\n"," And it's fantastic book have you read it. It  oh it's  wonderful it's about this Australian girl who sta who lives in Paris 'n' wuh how she goes  yeah anyway tt.\n"," Okay  what can we do for you Genevieve.\n"," Yeah.\n"," I can't believe my luck that I've actually managed to get through .\n"," Yeah it's not easy is it.\n"," Uh Sue um   when is it uh alright to uh prune a huge lemon tree when is it alright to give it a bit of a haircut.\n"," Give it a haircut any time of the year  Genevieve. You.\n"," No specific time.\n"," No specific time  aside that you will lose some of the fruit  but usually what happens with lemon trees is that you prune all the upright branches off and  leave the side ones 'n' so  they are fruiting anyway so once they are fruiting then then you just nip the tips of those out they branch  out so  you'll find  that the um citrus are   usually the rule of thumb for citrus is immediately after the um lot o last lot of fruit has been picked off so  lots of lemons around at this time of the year once that lot of fruit's gone  that's when you give it a trim. But if  you need to trim it back.\n"," My lemon tree I think it's Eureka which  uh I I've got y'know lemons uh.\n"," Seems to have  lemons all year round that's right . But they do have a main fruiting time and that's  their spring time . Then then you have a few lemons hanging around so if your lemon tree's say five or six metres high  what's the use of having a lemon tree that high . You might as well have it  that it's going to um you'd be able to pick the fruit you don't have to get a cherry picker to pick it.\n"," Uhuh and Sue can I just ask you something else please.\n"," Certainly.\n"," Uh at one time you had uh a recipe for fruit fly on uh for citrus trees also  I think it had water ammonia and something else.\n"," Yeah pretty close you've got water cloudy ammonia vegemite  and sugar that's right and are you connected to the internet.\n"," No I'm not.\n"," Okay it's on the internet site if you know someone who's got the internet go to Sue's Garden.\n"," Go to a library maybe  they'll tell you how to work things.\n"," Yeah dot com dot A U suesgarden as in one word  and um you'll get the whole recipe.\n"," Right  and it's good stuff for the fruit flies is it.\n"," It is good stuff as a attractant to  fruit flies actually Genevieve it's a it's a bait to attract the fruit flies before they cause the damage so you hang it in the tree early in the season.\n"," Thanks very much Genevieve Norma of Kewdale hello Norma.\n"," Hi Norma.\n"," Good morning Harvey good morning Sue. Um.\n"," Don't speak Dutch Norma by any chance.\n"," No I don't  double-dutch but not Dutch .\n"," Yeah that's what I said yeah .\n"," Um. Uh Adeniums Sue  can I prune that now or is it too late or too early or.\n"," About   well you can prune it now but I'd be laih waiting till it warms a little bit just a little bit . Ah well   this weather's been fantastic hasn't it it's been really  warm spring weather  but um usually the beginning of spring  is is just the general rule of thumb  yep so that  new growth yeah  very easy to um to to prune to look after so if you just wanna give it a trim up.\n"," Yeah 'cos it's looking  pretty awful at the moment.\n"," Yeah yeah do tend to .\n"," Yeah.\n"," So ih it's up to you but I'd be waiting a few weeks.\n"," Yeah I'll  do that.\n"," Okay.\n"," Thank you.\n"," You're very welcome Norma.\n"," Bye.\n"," Goodo thank you very much indeed to uh Norma and uh to everybody I wonder if we'll ever give that innuh there's a couple of um   interesting um events coming up have you got them there.\n"," I have Harvey and we've got a couple of events happening there's our orchid show happening um this weekend actually. It's on at the Newpark shopping centre so the last day today at Girrawheen the Wanneroo Orchid Society will feature beautiful display orchids from many countries incrood cluding  Australia and experienced growers will be available every day to advise on culture 'n' things and I'm sure the good people at the Wanneroo Orchid Society is um   not not phased if you bring a grotty old plant in 'n' say how do I fix this up so they really wanna promote and encourage the participation of growing orchids so they'll be able to help you with any details at the Newpark shopping centre in Girrawheen on today.

Hello Noelene of Shoalwater chatting away there on the phone.\n"," Hi Noelene.\n"," Hi Sue hi Harvey. Uh Sue I've got a Kaffir lime tree in a pot.\n"," How's it going.\n"," Uh well I've had it for about three years 'n' it's   it's growing nicely but it's never had a flower or a fruit on it.\n"," They don't have fruit you don't  have kaf Kaffir limes for the fruit you grow them  for the foliage  so so if you wanted a Kaffir lime for sorry a lime tree for its fruit  go for Tahitian lime  but the Kaffir lime is grown for its pungent brilliant foliage so you just pick a few leaves off 'n' cook with them.\n"," Yeah I  do.\n"," And um they are very hesitant in setting fruit that's not unusual.\n"," But they do have fruit don't they  because on the uh the tag it's got a  picture of a lime on it but.\n"," Yeah not very many  but they do  they are few and far between so mostly grown for its  for its foliage.\n"," So not doing anything wrong with this one then.\n"," Not doing anything if it's looking beautiful keep at it.\n"," Okay thanks  and the other one Sue  I've got a an eggplant tree.\n"," Yes.\n"," In a pot . And  excuse me it it does get fruit on it and they're like little golf balls and they're yellow and  hard and uh y'know they just don't do anything.\n"," Did you get this eggplant tree as a grafted eggplant  from Sunflower Garden Centre or somewhere like that.\n"," Ah somewhere in the northern suburbs  my mother gave it to me.\n"," Yeah. They um there's someone growing them   from there  uh they are grafted onto a root a hardy root stock that  then um will will keep growing beautifully and I think from memory there's prickles on the root stock  and the top should keep growing so  what if they get hard and don't do anything at this time of the year Noelene I wouldn't be worried about that  because of the cold. The what do you feed it with.\n"," Oh anything that comes to hand.\n"," Yeah it needs to be lots of food push it on I'm wondering  if it's actually the root stock that's taken over . Because it shouldn't have it should have big purple rooh  beautiful eggplants.\n"," They start out nice and purple  'n' then then they go yellow.\n"," Yeah and how big are they . Yeah they will yellow up  they will they will yellow up if they've been on the plant for too long. What I'd do  and just as an experiment let's see how we go is just feed it with PowerFeed liquid fertiliser  'n' just really push it on  and see if that makes a big difference for you.\n"," What every couple of weeks.\n"," Yeah definitely. Every couple of weeks.\n"," Okay.\n"," Okay.\n"," Thanks Sue.\n"," You're welcome t.\n"," Bye.\n"," Bye.\n"," Righto it's right on nine-thirty we'll take a break Susie.\n","\n","\n"," Twenty-seven minutes to ten goede morgen .

Now uh that's just a fantastic substitute that's getting it is a bit tricky so just  have to go to your l local garden centre 'n' see if they can find it 'n' see see if  we can work from there.\n"," And wuh  when's the best time to plant it.\n"," Oh I'd be planting it any time from now Jenny.\n"," Oh okay.\n"," This this plant spreads about two metres round it's very flat it's used a lot on road verges 'n' things  particularly up our area where there's just heavy soil and just lawn is not practical so  does very well another plant that works well is one called Hemiandra pungens H E M I A N D R A.\n"," H E M I N.\n"," A N D R A.\n"," A N D R A.\n"," Yep Hemiandra pungens that's a fantastic um ground cover  and that but that's prickly if you wanna walk on it  you need shoes so.\n"," So yeah the  other one might be better.\n"," Um the other one's better uh Lippia is another one that attracts bees the  um that's very tough that's a ground cover used a lot for a lawn substitute  and it has pink flowers once a year and those pink flowers are very attractive to bees so you just mow them off when they flower and.\n"," Oh right so you can just mow it off.\n"," Just mow that off  but um the flowers that's a really good one you duh grow that by tubes you can't grow that by seed you need to buy that by pla sorry yeah buy that as plants and plant  the runners . And that'll eventually creep into your lawn too so you need to really separate the area that's tough . Another plant that is a very interesting actually it's not bright green in its foliage but it's a greyey green has flat yellow flowers is a plant called Dimondia D I M O N D I A  that that looks like a really miniature gazania you know the form of the gazania it's really flat ground ground-hugging gazania and  that's a really tough one as well.\n"," Right okay oh that's.\n"," That gives you some choices Jenny.\n"," Yeah lovely  thank you very much for that.\n"," Good to talk to you.\n"," Great.\n"," Bye.\n"," Bye.\n"," Okay thank you very much indeed uh to Jenny she was uh very nice and now I what have I done here yeah what she was after was   grondslag beslaan . That's ground cover in Dutch.\n"," Grondslag beslaan.\n"," Uh grondslag beslaan.\n"," Beslaan. I'll remember that not .\n"," Yeah well it's probably wrong . And the pronunciation's  probably way wrong.\n"," That's probably why no one's .\n"," Hello Vicky of Balcatta.\n"," Oh good morning Sue and Harvey  how are you.\n"," Fantastic.\n"," Um my husband wants to put uh an olive tree out the front uh it'll be in full sun and he likes his frut et cetera to be the biggest you can get so  can you suggest  um um olive tree that has um the big fru  big fruit on it.\n"," And I've got it but the problem is there's one called U C one-five-seven I think it's one-five-seven hybrid  and it has huge fruit  huge like the size of cumquats.\n"," Oh yeah that's  what he'd like.\n"," But you need to pick them green and do something with them when they're green  because if you let them go go till they go black they're soft and mushy  so that's what happens with mine.\n"," Yep yep okay  that's fine yeah.\n"," Uh that variety has rea what they call really high flesh to pip ratio small pip lots of flesh . Uh you'll find um one of the best ones you can't go past kalamata olives Vicky  the for the flavour  ah and uh look I've got four or five different varieties down the driveway. This U C one-five-seven hybrid meaning University California the U C um is bred from that . Huge fruit but um you need to pick them and eat them and pickle them or process 'em when they're green.\n"," And the kalamata you don't have to do that obviously .\n"," No you don't you can have 'em when they're black as well 'n' a nice tree kalamata's probably more a widely available as well.\n"," Okay and how big does the kalamata one grow.\n"," Oh you'll be looking with a olive tree you can let them grow up to six metres high . Uh it's no use having fruit that high so  keep it at about four.\n"," Yep keep  it trimmed yeah  and and the U C one-five-seven  w how the same as that .\n"," Yeah that's a bushy plant mine would be five metres high now mine needs a trim  uh how it's growing but they're all pretty much the same they can be trimmed really easily that's that um keep him contained I've seen some fantastic olives standardised too . In Italy um on those slopes along Mediterranean coast they pollard them they trim them back hard every year  so they're huge trees  um huge trunks but they've  had their tops trimmed off.\n"," And sorry just one last question how   do we have to prepare the soil for those.\n"," Prepare the soil is dig yeah you've got lots of that um acih like that that sand that's on top of those swampy areas  so you need to dig a hole that will be at least sixty centimetres deep by the same wide  discard at least a third of the soil out of the bottom and put um soil improver in it mix that with the existing soil  and yeah the better   even though we say olive trees are tough they don't need much the better preparation you can give them the better the plants do . Yeah.\n"," Alright Sue  that's fantastic.\n"," You're welcome.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Bye.\n"," Okey-dokey thank you very much indeed nineteen minutes to ten and uh time for another break.\n","\n","\n"," Oh dear what a lovely surprise. Let's go to Kelmscott hello Evelyn.\n"," Hi Harvey how are you.\n"," Really well thanks.\n"," Good um I just want to know if anyone in the Kelmscott area do you know of anyone in the Kelmscott area that does fruit tree pruning. We've just moved into this house and  there's about six trees out the back need pruning.\n"," And it's like where do I start . Yeah call in to Colour Drop Garden Centre anh  and see if they can help you or they put you onto someone  they've been there for a long time.\n"," Yeah I kno  I know where they are yeah  also uh a bat plant  d'you uh know anywhere in W A where you can buy bat plants.\n"," I don't   no.\n"," They are absolutely beautiful nobody seems to know anything  about them  over here.\n"," I don't.\n"," What's a bat plant.\n","  A bat plant mm.\n"," W yeah what what is a bat plant.\n"," Don't know.\n"," It's oh it's like a   a lily it comes up like a lily type of thing but the b the flower itself looks just like a bat.\n"," There you go.\n"," They are absolutely beautiful.\n"," Tt I'm going to have to chase it up 'n' have a look 'n' find out . Evelyn where did you see them or when.\n"," In New South Wales  I was over there last year and everywhere you went all the markets 'n' that had these for sale.\n"," You know what might be the problem. They might be classed as a weed  over here . No over here  and that's the reason why they're not allowed in from  the start so if we know the we'll see if we can find the botanical name and I'll do some research for you.\n"," But they are absolutely beautiful.\n"," Okay we'll see  what I can find out.\n"," Have you got a query ab oh you no you've done  that. Listen now  how would you like to win a forty-five dollar Solvol citrus soap pack for uh for really throwing in a nice curly one this morning Evelyn.\n"," I would like to win anything .\n"," Okay  well you've won  one of those. I'll put you onto um grumpy 'n' he'll look after you.\n"," Alright thank you very much.\n"," Thanks Evelyn.\n"," Okay thanks a lot.\n"," Okay and now Ruth at Gwelup hello Ruth.\n"," Hello Harvey and Sue how's things.\n"," Really well.\n"," Harvey don't tell me you b barrack for the Hawks do you.\n"," I will tell you that.\n"," Well I love Shane Crawford so that's okay.\n"," Yeah oh that's alright then .\n"," Uh he's pass  he's allowed.\n"," Now I've got a lucky bamboo in soil and I think I'd like to try 'n' put it into into water 'n' stones if I could . Can I do that.\n"," Easy all you need to do is grab the sink or grab a bucket fill it up and tip it outta the pot wash all the soil off and away you go  that's all you need to do so simple and then if you've got a vase or some stones that you can put.\n"," Yes yes.\n"," Yep yeah no problem that's so easy  I think they actually do better in in water.\n"," Yeah well I seem to forget to water it a bit and  um.\n"," They don't like drying out.\n"," No  and I've got some Aquaplant hydro phonic hydroponic fertiliser.\n"," Now your hydroponic fertiliser is that high in other nutrients rather than nitrogen.\n"," Um.\n"," Tt do you know.\n"," It's got.\n"," Have a look at it.\n"," Nitrate nitrogen two-point-one-one ammonium nitrogen point-two . Total nitrogen two-point-three-one  phos phosphorus  potassium.\n"," Yeah yep. Those are high. I would be looking at you can use it but it's not ideal lucky bamboos need high nitrogen fertiliser not not um high phosphorus or all those other things so  it's better to use um a fertiliser that's high in nitrogen something like Thrive.\n"," Good on you Ruth that uh should answer the question now did I do good did I.\n"," You did so fantastic.\n"," Did I do good.\n"," Yes I think I think it's actually classed as   if it's a bat plant you can grow it in tropical areas so it doesn't grow so well here um Evelyn so just looking at some information that's on the internet. Paradise Distributors it's available if you go   under Burke's Backyard website there's a a fact sheet on the white bat plant which is \n","\n","-----\n","Content of NAT1-plain.txt:\n","\n"," One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one let's go to Melbourne. Anne-Marie welcome to Australia Talks Back.\n"," Oh hi how are you.\n"," Yeah good thank you.\n"," Um I just wanted to put a thought forward about the um cut in um   education and university fees.\n"," Oh the HECS funding yep yep.\n"," Yeah. Um   I had a thought about uh another repercussion that no-one's really thought of is that students who've had a free education they feel the urge or obligation to give something back to the community and um I think Brendan Nelson expressed a a worry that his education was paid for by the taxes of the working class   and perhaps if he'd paid for it paid for his own education he wouldn't have actually felt um the freedom or the urge to go into politics and have ideals that he could um work towards. He might've felt more obliged to go and earn some money and   keep his own um.\n"," Interesting thought Anne-Marie. Thank you very much indeed and uh Ron uh says \n"," Oh it's Sylvia in Sydney.\n"," Oh are you in Sydney well it sih  I've just relocated you to Canberra . Welcome to Sydney yes go on Sylvia.\n"," That's the right thing. Oh it's just about the travel . I went to Bali last year and I'm going again this year. My family live there they've been there  seven years. But they keep in touch with the Australian embassy all the time.\n"," And you feel  quite happy about about travelling in that.\n"," Yes. And  when I said to my son is it safe he said well is anywhere safe in the world really . It could happen in Sydney. So um .\n"," Yeah and what sort of people would we be if we let terrorists dictate where we took our holidays.\n"," Well they they'd enjoy it all the more. Really.\n"," Yes yeah. I mean it would be a sign that they'd won and I don't think they're gunna win this one.\n"," Well that's the thing yeah . But I noticed there's a lot more security at the airport in the hotels  at the school . So if people are and they said people are beginning to go back.\n"," Yes alright look thank you very much Sylvia nice to talk to you that's Sylvia in Sydney. And Neil echoes several other emails when he says \n"," Oh g'day Sandy.\n"," Yes g'day Fred.\n"," I I enjoy your program immensely.\n"," Thank you very much. It's a team  effort.\n"," I'm sure it is. Um what I wanted to say was that uh Brendan Nelson and his   ideology   and the ideology of the uh Liberal party in terms of public education and in terms specifically I mean I went to uni. Um my parents couldn't have   would never have been able to afford to send me to uni. Um and I went there uh and was supported by the state. Um and I find it extraordinary and in fact if you go through the whole realm of all those people John Howard um a Abbot. All of those people were supported by scholarships that were publicly funded and and yet they're turning around and destroying that and   uh I find it   and what really disturbs me is that nobody seems to care is that  everybody goes oh well  pay as you earn.\n"," But there are there are s there are some exceptions I I got a a a fax today from the the Central Queensland University and I was I was interested in their reason for not raising HECS fees. They're one of the very few who're not raising HECS fees and the reason that the uh the vice chancellor Glenice Hancock put out was that uh to increase fees by as much as twenty-five percent would be a burden to the communities serviced by the university.\n"," Yes I know but  I mean I'm a teacher  and uh I I know young graduates coming out now are coming out with debts of eighteen-thousand dollars twenty-thousand dollars fifteen-thousand dollars  a and they're only twenty years old they're twenty-one years old. So they've gotta pay that off before they even can begin to think about um uh uh you know buying their house  buying their car and all of that.\n"," But Fred isn't it isn't it . Yes but isn't it isn't it also uh damning that that a lot of people won't actually go to university now because of this.\n"," Yes precisely.\n"," Yes because I mean the the.\n"," they'll do a run away. No no exactly right.\n"," Yes. Look thanks Fred and uh you'll be interested in this next email comes from Peter in the Gold Coast hinterland who says \n"," Hello Sandy. Sandy uh the government exhorting the elderly back to work. I think that will create a workplace of monkeys. The reason why is they will deregulate uh the minimum wage and employees will uh will pay them peanuts. The ratio of full time to part time work Sandy is increasing you know and  hence a drop in disposable income as it is. For example the pensioners   apart from food   they pay more than their fair share of tax especially the G S T you know they arguably are the biggest consumers of handyman services. Re-allocating a maybe one or two percent of the extremely exorbitant defence budget for example. I mean that should take care of the welfare end of things.\n"," Thank you very much for your thoughts and uh on the same issue we had a a charming letter from Trish. Uh not sure where Trish was from but it was one of the few handwritten letters we've had in a long time and Trish says \n"," Hello Sandy  how are you.\n"," Very well indeed.\n"," Um my comment relates to some obvious misconceptions that are in evidence as far as how much people earn once they have graduated from university . And especially in the case of Mark from Queensland who is a teacher. We did some modelling in the nineteen-eighties specifically Sam Ball professor of education at Sydney University. And we compared what a teacher would earn with a bus driver. And until the teacher did their four year degree bachelor's degree and then did some teaching and perhaps came back to do a P H D they would be fifty-five before they earned the same amount of money as the bus driver . Fifty-five. Now the HECS load now is significantly greater than it was in the nineteen-eighties when Sam Ball did that calculation.\n"," So would you agree we've got an we had an email from another Peter and he said um \n"," This is correct . And it is even worse than that. At universities where I teach I teach at Charles Sturt University we're no longer competitors with um the school teaching system. They're earning more than than lecturers and associate lecturers  after a very short time in the the classroom. So where're our universities going to end up.\n"," That's a very big question. David great to talk to you thank you indeed uh for your time and expertise and Jim in Perth   thank you for waiting welcome Jim.\n"," Oh hello Sandy.\n"," Yes g'day.\n"," Um uh I've been a tutor and um I I wanna talk uh similar to what your last caller is the problems that universities have. But also the problems that students have voiced uh concerning the quality of their tuition . Wuh w what we have here is a a dynamic intp interplay between funding enrolments the staffing and the tuition itself . I don't believe that universities take their staffing adjustments lightly. Um ih ordinarily they'll take on staff if uh there needs to be uh some adjustment to courses that uh requires more work to bring them up to standard with uh what's known in recent research developments. And when the staff are taken on uh they need to be given some contractual security of employment . Okay so amongst these the funding and the enrolments the staffing the tuition uh the staffing is uh ha has got the least lag time   in a lot of ways hwh funding will be oh once a year um enrolment's once a year and tuition is left as wha what's what's uh what they can do after .\n"," After the rest of it yes. Alright look Jim I'm gunna leave it there th thank you very much indeed for your call Ruth at Banora Point hello Ruth.\n"," Hi Sandy.\n"," Yeah g'day.\n"," Uh g'day just a couple of points   um just regarding the superannuation   um I I'm a mature aged person and I tried to access of my superannuation to pay for retraining and I had to even if I could get it   I'd have to pay twenty per cent tax on it  and I feel that um some people may not necessarily wanna retrain through uni but maybe through TAFE and I think there should be a loan scheme introduced for TAFE courses.\n"," Thank you very much and  you had another point.\n"," Yeah uh the other the other point's oh I've forgotten what it was uh.\n"," Never mind.\n"," oh just quickly the other thing is about actually mature age people going back to work   when you look around in the community you hardly see anyone over fuh forty-five working anywhere .\n"," Yes.\n"," Okay.\n"," Thank you very much indeed nice to talk to you and uh Karen from uh uh Victoria says \n"," Yeah speaking.\n"," Yes Paul go ahead.\n"," Yeah um on climate change and and the reef uh it strikes me as a a problem that needs a big solution and part of that solution is um I see as biodiesel. And at the moment there's not much biodiesel available in Australia and the problem we have is the government is uh taxing the uh fledgling industry instead of encouraging it.\n"," Right and what what about other fuels.\n"," There's a lotta fuels on the horizon but most of them are still fossil based . Unfortunately we we don't have a lot of options um when it comes to uh renewable energy uh hydrogen is often touted as a um a future fuel but you still have to get the energy from somewhere to create the hydrogen. I guess biodiesel allows us to at least grow a fuel grow a canola crop  and turn it into biodiesel and then run it on your car so at least it's renew at least it's carbon neutral so it a si is a step in the right direction.\n"," Paul thank you very much indeed let me just give you the uh the four pr uh programs again so that if you're trying to get through you've uh you've got an idea of what we're talking about on Australia Talks Back tonight. Will we be working till we drop the whole look at the uh the idea that uh people should put off retirement and and work a little longer. Uh what's it like to travel in the age of terror those travel advisories and whether you take any notice of them uh and uh how they were put together it was a fascinating discussion on the program about that. Is higher education just for the rich and boy did that get a deluge of uh emails and faxes. And how can we save the Great Barrier Reef whose latest report card is not good it was interesting watching uh the rise in temperatures and the the panic that ensued I guess amongst climatologists and then those winds came in and the winds chilling the reef actually stopped or uh um negated some of the damage that was uh potentially about to be done   so uh c the climate actually stepped in and uh and did the right thing there. The number by the way is one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one. Right around the country and this is Neil in Bundeena  on the sunshine coast   g'day.\n"," Buddina er Sandy.\n"," Oh sorry where.\n"," Buh Buddina.\n"," Oh Buddina yeah okay.\n"," Yeah    uh we've just had a cyclone masquerading as a low pressure system go through here.\n"," Have you just ha uh just shortly.\n"," Oh yeah the last couple of three four hours.\n"," Woah. Heading in which direction.\n"," Uh  it's going it's going sort of down to Kingaroy I think. Somewhere \n"," Yeah head heading south.\n"," That's right.\n"," I'll I'll look out for it . So Neil you wanted to talk about HECS and ageing.\n"," Yeah uh th just a brief comment about Brendan Nelson   um these people I don't know about this government they don't seem to think in terms of people they think in terms of numbers. He was emphasising that the participation rate won't go down but what about the effect on the people that are going to have to   you know get these debts . Anyway this point's been made by others so I won't persist with it but with the ageing population   I'm seventy-two.\n"," Yep.\n"," And uh I paid my taxes all my life. And including the uh four and a half per cent or whatever it was levy that was uh designed to uh be extracted from us to to pay for our pensions a guaranteed pension. Now I'm still working  um   but the government's   line that it's   a matter of y'know not having skilled workers and that sort of thing is why they want to bring them back it's got nothing to do with it. Look I'm quite happy to work. But   I've got to do it for nothing I have to do it pro bono I'm an anthropologist  mainly because if I uh charge a fee I'm taxed at about seventy per cent. Now if they want us to have an .\n"," That's out that's outrageous though isn't it.\n"," Oh it's it's  crazy. It's absolutely crazy and it gih gives a lie to this business that they uh   they're interested it y'know worried about the fact that there aren't people getting y'know with the experience staying in the workforce well   I've got news for them y'know . A lot of us a lot of old people I do a bit of lecturing for uh for University of the Third Age and so forth and  y'know we're happy to contribute. Delighted to. But give us a bit of a go y'know .\n"," Yes okay look thank you indeed for your for your call. And that's uh Neil from the Sunshine Coast. And uh very similar sorts of views from Joe in uh Greensborough in Victoria who says \n"," Hot.\n"," Hot.\n"," I d d wanted t to tell you I my wife and I have just returned from eleven months in the Greek islands.\n"," Oh eleven months in the Greek islands wow.\n"," A a a we went uh  but w you you'd land at Athens and you walked in the airport and nearly d d die of a shock.\n"," Right why.\n"," Ooh uh there's gentlemen w with machine guns walking everywhere uh and it's kind .\n"," But wouldn't you rather Ron wouldn't you rather have gentlemen walking with machine guns than have terrorists around the place.\n"," Yes but can I uh I I tell you the rest of it 'n' then w we go down to Piraeus  'n' we get on the ferry and we uh went out to Ios. And we theh theh theh th then rang up our consulate and said we want to go to Epidaurus and Delphi and Corinth and so forth and they told us what to do and and what not and then we got the bright idea we w w would slip over t t to Turkey and we did and they told us what to do   and then we got the bright idea we would go over to Brindisi  and th we we were uh informed well uh that there were certain re restrictions but .\n"," So hang on what you're saying Ron is every time before you went somewhere you rang the consulate and checked.\n"," Uh uh yes.\n"," Yeah good yeah.\n"," A and I will say this uh and that the one that really uh we decided we'd go uh uh over to Knossos on Crete . A and when we got on the ferry we'd called into Ios  eh eh eh every second day we called in   the captain lined me up and said was I so and so and I said yes he said this is from your consulate   and this was instructions how to behave and conduct ourself on Crete.\n"," Oh good on them. Oh I hope you.\n"," thought it was wonderful.\n"," I hope you wrote the wrote the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a really nice letter 'cos it's not very often we hear really good positive stories but Ron I've got a question for you   all last year you were ringing up Australia Talks Back complaining about the weather and and the drought and how bad it was for farmers. How on earth can you afford eleven months in the Greek islands .\n"," Because  uh uh uh a a we got the r r rain at the g g g good time  a a and g g g g got.\n"," That was the rain I sent you wasn't it Ron.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Yeah yeah.\n"," And I gotta too tell you something eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh el else. The wool grew well and the sheep prospered.\n"," I'm glad to hear   Ron have a great weekend that's Ron just out of Wagga who uh regulars will remember last year   was one of our regulars talking about the the drought   Lillian. How are you Lillian over there in W A nice to talk to you.\n"," Yes nice to talk to you  again. There's one aspect of education that I'm very concerned about   my grand-daughter is rather upset she said there're big advertisements in children's magazines or youth magazines for children to join the military. Now five c uh colleges have closed in California and within twenty-four hours the military are in signing 'em up for packages for the military . Mr Watson returned from Iraq and he said every one but one serviceman from America he'd spoken to had their education through the military and I'm very concerned about this. If poorer people are not going to be educated what is going to happen to them   I know my grand-daughter's really concerned.\n"," Yes look thank you very much indeed 'n' there are many people who feel the same way. Sharon from Coogee says \n"," Hello there.\n"," Yes.\n"," Yes I wanted to speak to two issues the issue of the HECS fees and also the issue of um older workers. I'm um a mature person I'm retired now   but I was also one of Gough's girls I was the lucky person who  uh got a free education as a result of Gough's uh wonderful changes to the education system. I would never have been able to afford a degree without it. Now um I am now retired I would work   twenty to twenty-five sometimes more hours a week voluntarily using my degree in areas that the government chooses not to fund for example bereavement support palliative care   uh community development those areas are not appropriately funded or sufficiently well-funded by any level of government and I'm not alone I know of of many others  that do the same.\n"," And we have got probabry probably had twenty or thirty emails saying exactly that.\n"," Yeah.\n"," So there are an awful lot of people who'd agree with that. Yeah.\n"," So to say you know that we should be working is we are working it's just that we're not paid for it.\n"," Yes. It was interesting theh Doug uh from Canberra sent us an email who said uh \n"," Yes it also touches on the issue of people who are have to um work for their unemployment benefit . Um on on so-called voluntary schemes for which they are not   uh they are neither the qualified nor experienced   um just to I think ih in in a. Okay it's it's an undignified way of saying to people you're not uh worth getting a a basic amount of money to live on   you damn well work for it and  and the work that they do is is very often not um useful to them in even in uh career.\n"," Anne thank you indeed and have a great weekend up there in Hervey Bay   lovely part of the world Amen in Sydney are you s are you there now. Hello Amen.\n"," Yes yes I'm here.\n"," Hello welcome.\n"," Uh thank you thank you look I uh I wanted to touch on um two topics one was HECS and one was superannuation. Um I'm uh I'm actually twenty-three years old and uh and I attended university uh about uh three years ago  straight out of high school.\n"," Yep.\n"," Now there um what what concerned me while I was at university was the number of people that were going there because it um pressures from family to actually attend university complete a degree. Um there was no desire for them to actually hold a university degree other than to please their parents and um.\n"," Yeah it was just family pressure yep.\n"," Absolutely  absolutely look I can tell you that um I succumbed to family pressure to actually go to university and look   I was a high achiever at high school and but I didn't know what I wanted to do at university and I went in there wih y'know blindly and I um and I did an I T degree   and um and look it was actually incomplete when I decided to um go into the workforce and look I've I've prospered uh so much from from the learning experience that uh that I had at university and and the skills that I gained not so much in what I was studying but but how to think how to learn just like that uh that email that was written in earlier and that really that was what um uh y'know what I learned from . Um uh now there's there's just not enough emphasis on that 'n' look   um there's there's uh a another point that what that leads to the the number of people going just for the sake of it is uh ih is an inflation in the number of uh students actually uh y'know enrolled in their course studying it   completed and and you've got overcrowded lecture theatres uh overcrowded tutorials and and um a and now they're y'know the universities uh need more funding to to support this this increase .\n"," So how d uh I mean you've you've pointed your finger to a really important problem Amen but how on earth   do you solve something like that how do you solve the problem of people putting pressure on kids to go to university kids who don't want to or the societal belief that you're not gunna get on in life unless you've got a degree which is  blatantly silly as well.\n"," I can tell you that if I had a counsellor at uh at high school  that really counselled me as to my choices look in year ten I really uh agreed to people leaving high school when they knew they weren't gunna go to uni when they knew they didn't want to   I was uh completely for people starting apprenticeships because the amount of money that they'd save themselves and they'd have a foot in the door in an industry that they that they love y'know mechanics and hairdressers and the like  these people are they're going to going through year twelve and then going into uni doing some   arts course which they just barely scraped into   wasting their time and their money and uh and in the end they're not really uh y'know applying themselves and and getting any sort of a skill that would that would benefit this uh y'know their their community and um   and yeah look the way around it is counselling at uh at school I think if.\n"," At school I think that's a that's a good point Amen thank you very much I've gotta move on to Doug in Karratha. Hello Doug welcome.\n"," Hello Sandy.\n"," Yes g'day.\n"," And good show this this week uh  three topics one is em retirement. I've been salary sacrificing now for uh nearly twelve years  and em coming up to my fifties and g I'm seriously looking at retiring in my mid fifties  and that's the lesson I learnt from my apprenticeship in uh many years ago at Midland Workshops where   people worked through to sixty-five   we'd have the big em farewell for them and six months later the uh flags  would be at half mast and they'd die basically. .\n"," Yep yep. They'd retire at sixty-five and then the funeral at sixty-six.\n"," Yeah  basically and that happened time and time again but the big concern I have is for my em children. What chance have they got with regards to superannuation especially with the current job prospects where people are the uh standardised long-term employment jobs have gone and people are very much looking at short-term contractual jobs.\n"," Yes yes.\n"," And saving for superannuation there's gunna be a nightmare for them . And uh I don't know what we're gunna do about that. The other one is HECS fees. Em I've got a daughter currently at university and I'm encouraging her to go on and do her em honours and masters simply because of the fact that em retiring or leaving uni with a degree really doesn't guarantee you any sort of position at all so   the costs of those are exacerbated simply because to guarantee yourself some work you really have to go on and em do your masters a lot of the time. Um and the third one while I'm on a roll is uh with regard to the environment I heard on your show some bloke talking about em having to build a whole heap of new power stations if they convert to gas. That's not really the case basically all you need to do is retube the the boilers themselves .\n"," Yeah the the retubing of the boilers yes  we had several people  sent us an email about that yeah.\n"," And you can go straight into em gas-fired power station at minimal cost and you actually get more efficiency out of them so you increase the efficiency.\n"," Yep.\n"," Of the of the power stations. So.\n"," Thank you very much . That's good to  talk to you and uh have a great weekend let's head to uh Michael in Canberra hello Michael.\n"," Hello yes uh my point relates to to both uh terrorism and travel and the the greenhouse gases issue  and one of your wuh  your show Earth Beat a number of years ago made the point that um   air travel is has enormous consequences for greenhouse gases and I guess what I wanted to say is that unrestrained um tourism especially through air travel is a kind of ecoterrorism in it's own right   basically.\n"," Wow there's a there's an interesting thought.\n"," Okay.\n"," Yep   thank you very much indeed. Bill in Lismore welcome to the program Bill.\n"," Sandy  great show.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Um yih I listened last night about uh coral reefs . Uh there was there was a woman on the show I think she came from uh A C F or the World Wildlife Fund   I was disappointed that she she dismissed uh population reduction as a possible solution to the problems a couple of callers mentioned that.\n"," Yeah I I heard that . I I heard that but I didn't hear her so much dismiss it outright as as say that y'know look that's a whole other debate that we need to have.\n"," Yes yeah.\n"," you're talking about Anna Reynolds's comments yeah.\n"," Yes yes that's right. Well can I explain what I mean basically I think that the coral reefs dying is a is a s is is just another casualty of the global impact of humans on their environment   um and you can you can uh divide the or break down the impact of humans on the on the world uh into two factors one is the ecological footprint that is the that is a measure of the the amount of uh mess that each indiv average individual makes  and multiply that by the number of people   now if we were to try and make a su substantial reduction in our ecological footprint it would it would involve a huge and and uh almost unacceptable change to the wa to our way of life yet yet population reduction is actually very easy and very achievable. The answer's right under our noses.\n"," But why don't we have an aj a uh um a population policy for the  for the country.\n"," Good point.\n"," Yeah   yeah alright look thank you for for raising that let's head uh to Elvis in Sydney hello Elvis.\n"," Uh hello Sandy.\n"," Yes g'day.\n"," G'day. Uh the general assumption seems to be that if you want a good education   you need to enrol in a university or some other   educational institution. Well I think you can get a good education by listening to the ABC going to libraries um   probably uh evening classes at uh technical colleges  and uh and uh and the like. Mm \n"," Yep. I think an awful lot of other uh of people would agree with that and I know a lot of people uh Elvis in uh in really good um jobs around the place who don't have a university education. Uh it's not the be all and end all of course it obviously helps in a lot of lot of careers. I think doctors are one of them. Let's go go Audrey in Sydney hello Audrey welcome.\n"," Sandy hello  look I I hope   I missed the barrier reef night and I hope this hasn't been raised but the Democrats   last year uh and before c huh collected clear evidence that um vast areas of coral sea will be released to oil companies and they've been pressing for legislation   to um prevent this by extending the marine park . So there wouldn't be oil exploration .\n"," Yes I don't think the uh the question of of uh extending the marine park came up on the program last night but it's a it's an interesting one  and one that the Demuh I remember the Democrats raising yeah.\n"," And it's pretty obvious that it's hard you know it's going to lead to the degradation of the coral reefs I doh I my point is it doesn't matter what party you belong to   just t to keep that in mind and so that the major parties you know take an interest in it.\n"," Thank you very much indeed that's Audrey in Sydney and Peter in Cairns hello Peter.\n"," Oh hi mate how are you.\n"," Yeah good.\n"," Look I just wanted to support the previous uh caller. I'm doing a masters degree. It's costing about fifteen-thousand dollars . Um there's no way that when I finish it in uh twelve months time I'll be able to turn around saying to my employer I'll have another fifteen-thousand dollars a year thanks.\n"," Yeah it just doesn't work does it.\n"," No it's done I mean I'm sure that there is   there are people that do do it for the money and that's fine. But I I think I'm like a lot of people that uh we do these degrees out of personal and professional interest because whether we like it or not   there is only the information in our chosen areas that is taught at that level.\n"," Yes yeah. Thank you very much indeed. This is Australia Talks Back the number's one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one and uh we head to Stuart at Glenroy in Victoria hello Stuart.\n"," How are you Sandy.\n"," Yeah good thank you.\n"," Uh love your program um I just had a s an alternative view on this on the HECS fees . Um it would probably cost the government a little bit of money to start with but as soon as the person starts working after they've finished their degree all their tax goes straight to their HECS debt.\n"," Ah so it's it's actually uh earmarked and um  yep.\n"," And it it would encourage would free up their   uh taxable income for a start so they'd be able to pay more G S T and uh they'd just would wouldn't be a burden on their income   and y'know with a lotta people they'd be paying four five thousand dollars a year tax to start with anyway once they finish their course so that most people would um have their HECS debt paid off probably within three or four years. They'd be contributing extra G S T and so on.\n"," Interesting thought thank you very much indeed. Peter in Hobart thanks for waiting Peter welcome to the program.\n"," Well that's a brilliant idea the last speaker  has had wonderful. Look I I haven't heard your other program nor have I heard tonight I tuned in most recently. .\n"," Well Peter welc welcome aboard.\n"," Oh thank you.\n"," This this is the biggest talkback program in Australia and you've just made it one person bigger.\n"," Running late tonight . Um I've heard Brendan Nelson justify the charges in terms of   only those who get jobs and have money will have to refund these HECS charges. But not long ago I talked to a university lecturer who said that her classes were full of people who were doing courses but whom she knew would never work because they were doing it for hobby purposes . These were often mature age people and they thought this is great I've got nothing to do I'll do a university course it's most satisfying fulfilling and it's wonderful.\n"," Yes.\n"," Now they're not going to pay for it. And they're taking up space time resources everything else. How big is that problem. Is it a significant problem  does it exist. I'm sure it does but how big is it.\n"," It'd be really interesting to get the figures I mean we've we've had  people send us emails ab s claiming to know these figures and one one  email that came in this week said that fifty per cent of places at universities are now mature age people.\n"," Right well how can they not know the answer to those questions  when they enter into such a scheme as this   where the I've got two daughters uh approaching yi well one's at uni and one's approaching uni age. And they're going to have this debt   which admittedly won't have to be paid until they earn significant salaries but it will deprive them of everything else that we would have used in your and my time  uh at that stage in our life uh because they'll have this thing hanging over their head.\n"," Yes yeah exactly Peter thanks very much indeed that's Peter from Hobart. And on Australia Talks Back we uh we're gunna go to Freo and to Fremantle and Paul hello Paul.\n"," Hi there how are you going.\n"," Yeah very well thanks Paul.\n"," Uh look um I just wanted to suggest to people what a uh a program I saw on channel two a few years ago now.\n"," Sorry can I just ask what topic are we talking about.\n"," Oh m m global warming.\n"," Global warming and the reef yep uh yep.\n"," Yeah uh uh it's just that they their theory was having dug into a uh some guys Americans dug into a a river in South America and and found out that uh back in uh uh dinosaur days or not uh it it probably the the w the same thing we're going through now happened in the past and also w digging down they found that they had huge droughts uh uh uh y'know and .\n"," Yes I I h I actually heard on the program the other day that um some nine-hundred years ago or so or nine-thousand years ago or so there had been other uh climate events like this. The problem is that uh uh a as was said uh very adroitly by one of the guests on the program that it's uh it's not within the thinking space of the uh either the local environment minister or the local tourism minister you need to think in terms of how does this affect the reef for next year and the year after that thinking in decades not hundreds and hundreds of years but yes true the uh the climate record has changed over the years and shown some some pretty warm spots. Paul in Canberra thank you for waiting Paul.\n"," Hello Sandy a pleasure. I wanted to talk about uh retirement and uh and an ageing workforce. Um I'll just quickly give you a snapshot of the situation that I'm in. Um I had the experience of being in the public service for twenty years   and the total effect of the way in which the public service is run and I know this applies to large private uh enterprises as well   was that it created a very toxic work environment. Most of the people I know which of uh in all the areas that I've worked in over over the twenty years were just waiting to retire . They couldn't bear the agony of being disempowered in the workplace in all the myriad ways that it happens. And since then I've been lucky I took a year off I gradually regained my strength being away from that environment and at the age of nearly fifty I've reinvented myself I've gone away and done a mature age masters degree.\n"," Oh got yourself a big HECS debt.\n"," No I  paid two-th two and a half thousand dollars a unit uh  but of course I could afford it 'cos I was mature age . So anyway leaving that to one side  and now I'm I'm I'm pumped I feel all the energy of youth returning to me I'm making progress in new work environments that seem to be better managed.\n"," Yep.\n"," Perhaps a fluke  who knows but.\n"," And and healthier environments.\n"," Healthier environments . But also I guess because I've got a little bit of capital behind me and now I can make the offer to resign   um quite meaningful and I know that I'm no longer in the clutches of people who would just squeeze me dry  I have a lot of energy.\n"," Fantastic.\n"," And and so anyway I just think that that does have application to the whole issue of of of a mature age workforce mature age students   um and I've heard quite a lot of debate obviously over the last uh few weeks on the radio.\n"," Yes.\n"," And the number of people who've said oh look I'd never go back to work I was just y'know disempowered and I couldn't bear it.\n"," Yes. And well you're proof that it's not true thank you indeed for calling and we go to Judith in Ulladulla. Hello Judith welcome to Australia Talks Back.\n"," Ooh yeah  there. Oh right um it's me yeah.\n"," Yes Judith go ahead.\n"," Oh good well well I t I've been trying to upskill upskill upskill and I've I've done my this 'n' this 'n' this 'n' I'm up to now um   diploma I've done that 'n' uh 'n' now I'm uh heading for a uh a degree. It really doesn't seem to matter. 'Cos I haven't had the um previous work experience in that field  uh um even.\n"," So even though you've gone and upskilled you have still finding it difficult to get work.\n"," Yes  because none of my previous experience even though I've been conveyancing   statistics and and no matter where I was it doesn't uh they all say no no no you can't put that on your resume 'cos it's far too far away.\n"," Yes.\n"," That's ridiculous it seems to me.\n"," So how long have you been looking for work Judith.\n"," Oh well looking for work uh well now I'm in in the fifty bracket but   I've done all sorts of things and doesn't seem to matter.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COME8-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Mix one-oh-six-point-five We Did It All For Love of course the Love Line's open on one-three-hundred-double-eight-love.

And if anyone complains about it disturbing a a function or an event this afternoon  naughty .\n"," They will get a.\n"," Big smacks . Absolutely incredible amounts of rain I hope your garden's looking gorgeous. Mine certainly is I'm sure it's grown about five inches over the last week wonderful rain in Sydney and uh and throughout the suburbs. Absolutely terrific we've got a full board of calls but of course you if you wanna ring in one-three-one-eight-seven-three lots of prizes to give away today as well lots of little gardening surprises so stay tuned we've got our lucky member's prize a g really good prize today Yates Pest Oil which I think always comes in handy and let's go to Anne at Bradbury good morning.\n"," Good morning Linda and Luke. Um I'm ringing about an azalea that we've got it's very healthy it's just finishing flowering and it's been absolutely beautiful but the my question's very specific the previous owners of the house had one of those succulent plants and it was planted very close to the azalea and we've just got rid of that in the last few weeks and so the azalea's very stunted on that side. So we're wondering   not just oh how to prune it anyway but how to p encourage that side to recover and  prune it so it looks less lopsided or what we should be doing.\n"," Okay well I would just prune it equally all over  and not touch that side.\n"," Oh okay.\n"," The extra sunlight and space that it now has because you've removed the succulent will encourage the growth on that side anyway.\n"," Started to all.\n"," Exactly and it might take two two years or three years to uh equal out uh but that's really all you can do and of course um spraying or watering with the uh seaweed solutions  whether you choose Maxicrop Seasol or any of the other seaweeds on the market I'm.\n"," We've got the Maxicrop.\n"," Beautiful  well that's excellent in fact Maxicrop's terrific.\n"," But how much do you prune where do you prune down to ab.\n"," Well I like to just prune ih depending on the bush of course um a well pruned and well maintained bush should only need y y'know two or three inches all over  basically the flowerheads.\n"," Oh okay that's what  we weren't sure about we  we didn't want to cut it drastically and discover that was the wrong thing to do.\n"," You can prune drastically don't get me wrong  if something's been let go a cam an azalea is looking completely outright freaky cam  y'know sometimes it gets out of control . You can prune them back hard but no in your case um a short back and sides Anne for you a like  a boy's haircut.\n"," Okay thanks for that.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Have a nice day.\n"," You too good bye.\n"," Bye.\n"," Hello Iris.\n"," Good morning Linda and Luke. Um we've got a vegie patch which we gave a rest this year f from the winter vegies . We planted annuals um petunias nasturtiums and pansies . And also Mother's Day flowers I can't remember the name\n"," chrysanthemums.\n"," Yes chryslyha  chrysanthemums.\n"," Yeah. But we wanna put the vegies back in in the winter can we dig these over not the chrysanthemums but the others.\n"," Um.\n"," Um or should we pull them up and put them in the um compost bin which is best.\n"," The latter . Put them put them in the p compost bin  if they were legumious  for example legumes like peas  beans  or anyth yeah anything that y'know fixes nitrogen . Uh like pea-shaped flowers  then I would definitely um build it into the soil . But with those annuals I would just put them into the compost and let them compost down.\n"," Compost down with the chrysanthemums 'cos they would keep going could we dig them up and move them and what time of the year is the best time of the year.\n"," Well you could do that now  I suppose  yes it's such a lovely w week really  uh we're getting such nice m wuh mild weather I know it's gunna heat up and today will be quite warm . But uh uh I imagine from looking at the weather forecast  but uh yes chrysanthemums are perennials  uh and they do flower in in uh for yuh in Autumn for  Mother's Day  uh and so moving it now is really at the beginning of its life cycle  if you think about yeah the 'n' y y'know y you you'd have a good success rate if you moved it.\n"," Okay thank you very much.\n"," My pleasure Iris . Good luck  that sounds lots of fun converting  a flower patch into a vegie patch.\n"," She's got a big day ahead a fun day  twelve minutes past six shall we go to Greg.\n"," Let's go to Greg. Good morning.\n"," Yes good morning luh Linda and Luke uh I was just wondering if you could help me I have a plum tree. Um and I would like to spray it but I don't know what to uh spray it with I don't want to use chemicals.\n"," Right good well that's great then no spraying  what what would you want to spray it against what are you getting with your plum tree  how.\n"," Yeah fruit fly.\n"," Well that's fine you don't have to spray with um to prevent floo fruit fly . When the um plums are starting.\n"," Yes.\n"," Then you just put a fruit fly dak pot in the tree.\n"," A dak pot.\n"," A dak pot  um and you use some insect killer uh uh there's a one on the market called um uh basically I just think it's called in in fruit fra fruit fly insect killer  and you mix a few little drops of that um into um vegemite and honey  and you put that into uh a dak pot or which is duh y'know just a a plastic drink container  um with some holes and and um some plugs around the outside just so the um uh the fruit fly has an entrance to get in  now the the sweetness of that mix attracts the fruit fly and then the the few drops you could just use the fr um y'know that if you wanted to do an organic method  just the the vegemite and the honey or peanut butter mixed in together  because they usually can't get out. They usually feed themselves . Um but if you want to make it a little bit more potent you could just add a few drops of that fruit fly um uh uh ih in insecticide in there.\n"," Oh okay thanks a lot for that.\n"," No worries no spraying nice and easy and safe.\n"," Okay thanks a lot.\n"," Thank you Greg.\n"," Thank you goodbye.\n"," Bye-bye  and that can be done of course with all fruit. Sorry darling . Peaches plums apples uh or anything that gets the fruit fly you can put the fruit fly dak pots in.\n"," Uh I was about to say we'll take a break uh the you're right about the weather today Linda you've been listening very carefully  mainly sunny in Sydney's forecast today and a high of twenty-six degrees so a bit warmer . Uh Liverpool twenty-nine and Richmond and Penrith thirty  today  it's mainly sunny. Now Sunday few afternoon showers and thunderstorms. Sydney sixteen to twenty-three tomorrow so it will cool off so more showers on the way on Sunday but today should be mainly sunny a terrific day.\n"," Do you want me to tell you a little secret.\n"," Okay.\n"," Just quickly. Tomorrow is dad's birthday.\n"," Oh really.\n"," Yes.\n"," And he's coming in.\n"," He's coming in.\n"," Oh.\n",".\n"," We'll bake a cake.\n",".\n","\n","\n"," Taking calls in the Garden Clinic with Luke and Linda. Jenny from Kurrajong good morning.\n"," Good morning to you. I've been desperately waiting for Saturday morning so I could  phone you and find out the answer to my problem.\n"," Oh I'm so glad we can be of help.\n"," I have started a garden completely from scratch and now my vegetable garden I've just started doing and um I've thought I've fed the soil very well and done all the right things I'm trying to go sort of organic.\n"," Good girl where are you in Kurrajong.\n"," I'm in Cedar Ridge ro.\n"," Oh I know that very well . I used to live on East Kurrajong Road.\n"," Oh okay yes. Uh.\n"," A hard climate up there isn't it. Has it  been raining up there uh this week.\n"," Oh we've had the most incredible rain  absolutely.\n"," And the dams filling are they.\n"," Well the dams all around. As I drive I can hardly look at the road I just  look at all the dams and they actually over so many are overflowing.\n"," Wonderful news.\n"," It's I've I've only been up here about eighteen months but it's just amazing.\n"," It's beautiful I was up there during the drought and it was really depressing and the fires actually that that the fires that Christmas.\n"," Yeah  well we weren't here for the fires but I'm looking at one of my trees here it's must be about oh thirty metres high and there's it's   black right to the top.\n"," Yes.\n"," So.\n"," Well we lost a couple of houses in my road on that uh on that terrible Christmas. Um but I know a lot of them have been rebuilt and a lot of families starting from scratch but it's such a lovely community up there.\n"," Oh it is. It's.\n"," So your organic vegie patch . You're starting from scratch.\n"," Actually growing in in polys in broccoli boxes 'cos you know what the soil's like  up here so.\n"," Well the good news uh is up there you can get all of that horse manure.\n"," Yes I I I get a lot of the stuff and I get sheep manure and everything like that .\n"," That's what I grew my vegie patch out of when I was up there . Basically completely cor uh well rotted horse manure.\n"," Okay. Now my problem is I've put in these little lettuce seedlings and they're only probably three inches high and I've only had planted them out about three weeks ago  but they're bolting to  seed.\n"," That's because.\n"," What have I done wrong.\n"," Lettuce is really a cool climate crop.\n"," Ah.\n"," Which means that they're much better over autumn and winter than spring and summer. And because we had that really hot weather before we had the rain y'know those  thirty plus days. The sih um really hot weh weather uh induce lettuce to go straight to seed. Very very quickly so it's much better I know it's weird it I always  find the irony . The irony of the situation is that lettuce  you eat in summer in summer  but in fact it's really hard to grow in summer because if it's in a full sun position it will always bolt. Bolt  to seed which I love because it does bolt to seed it just elongates and off you go . So other.\n"," three inches high.\n"," Yep exactly  it's so it's uh it's the irony of the gardening world so um.\n"," Put some shade cloth over it.\n"," Uh well uh in a shady sp a shadier spot  but it's the heat is going to do it too.\n"," next to water tank so it's sort of half shade you know so.\n"," Yeah it I mean lettuce we m I say we dad had the best crop of lettuce and it's just at the end now uh of the uh uh he had uh he had seriously ten different types of lettuce I mean the types of wonderful lettuce you can get these days is just terrific  but I have to say he planted it in in uh winter. And it was the beautiful winter crop right through the cooler months um and now um in the vegie patch we should really be concentrating on all the Mediterranean vegetables uh basically um capsicum eggplant and um tomatoes zucchini and squash are all terrific. Now with the lettuce or the um the leafy vegetables concentrate on rocket. And um the rainbow chard spinach and things like oh y'know all the herbs . 'Cos I make very herby salads in summer because the herbs do quite well. Basil and all of those sorts of things . But get them in now get all those herbs in now because planting them any later into the hot weather into summer and again they'll bolt to seed.\n"," Yes now I've got all those herbs in I ha I have it all that and I was thinking of trying to have my vegetables y'know all through the summer my own stuff so this has put paid to my theory.\n"," Yes . Get a good guh um vegetable book I tell you what my absolute oh bible is a book called The Complete Book of Vegetables Herbs and Fruit. Uh it's absolutely wonderful it's Cameron House is the publisher  it's quite a heavy book uh like it probably I call it my bible it's probably as heavy as a bible as well but I tell you what any time I need to know anything it's got everything about every fruit and herb and vegetable in it and such an amazing resource for you and just to let you know certain things about that lettuce not a good um warm uh month crop. S really concentrate on the rockets and the Mediterranean vegetables there Jenny and good luck with it.\n"," Very ironic that this wonderful summer salad   vegetable  doesn't like growing in summer  but there you.\n"," Not not in Sydney that's for sure.\n"," But it's not your fault . Mila good morning.\n"," good morning.\n"," Hi Mila.\n"," Hi how are you.\n"," Good how are you.\n"," Yeah I got a problem on my peaches nectarines pree uh previous years I got a good fruit. But last year it's uh when you look outside it's okay but there is some black spots  on the fruit  and when you open it's rotten . So I didn't get even one piece of of fruit.\n"," Well it's just a seasonal thing I wouldn't worry there's nothing you can do for this year Mila unfortunately sometimes fruit have better years than others and I think yes you've got a fungus and a and a and a rot in the fruit uh I really don't think there's much you can do uh at all this year you know you could next year um water in with uh anti-rot around the tree as a preventative for next year but uh nothing you can do this year unfortunately uh and I I would just fingers crossed that next year's fruit isn't um susceptible to the same rot.\n"," Thanks for your call Mila we do have to leave it there um we've got Sandra's diary coming up soon and more of your calls are welcome on one-three-one-eight-seven-three you can call through now you're listening to the Garden Clinic on Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," Yes top of the morning to you nice to have your company Luke Bona here with Linda Ross this morning and some lines are available you   powered through some calls in that last half hour one-three-one-eight-seven-three and Two G B dot com you've got a couple of uh emails here Linda can I read one to you. Um in fact we did touch on this last week but you can uh you can repeat this it's from Manly Vale Elizabeth can pool water salted   be used on the garden ih uh it's nearly overflowing at the moment and instead of wasting it I would like to make use of it.\n"," Oh depends what you're growing but uh it really depends what you're growing I would worry about certain things uh so no. I would b I would be a little bit worried about this.\n"," Do you feel guilty when your   when your pool is filled but it's it's also probably a very good opportunity for you to backwash your pool. Uh 'cos you gotta do that occasionally so if you got a it's it's a salt water pool so you've probably got a cartridge. Uh and anyone with a Diatomaceous Earth filter if your pool is full and ih you do feel terribly guilty running that water off but give it a backwash 'n'   and that's the time to do it I su I suppose.\n"," Thanks Luke. Yes I would very worried a lot of plants hate salt and uh and a lotta plants won't even grow around a salt water pool just because of the splash of the salt water. Okay straight out to Pamela at Normanhurst good morning.\n"," Good morning to you but um. I learn a lot from your program each uh weekend thank you very much.\n"," Terrific.\n"," I've got a lovely bush garden uh surrounded by trees turpentine gums . Uh azaleas and um tree ferns and um   tt yes. And I've been given a stag horn for a birthday present it's very healthy and I want to know how to keep it healthy . And where I should hang it what aspect.\n"," Well I like to keep my stag horns in morning sun. Uh or dappled shade considering that's where they grow  I mean I have seen up in Dorrigo I go bushwalking um through those mountains and the stag horns up there are just incredible. And they like dappled sun under turpentines or under eucalypts that's where they grow so your environment there at Normanhurst will be perfect a dappled sun just as long as you're not getting any of the hot afternoon sun.\n"," Yes that's what I was thinking because there are parts of the garden that get the westerly sun.\n"," Yes. As all gardens . But try not to try to protect it from the hot afternoon sun uh but and I mean I have seen stag horns very healthy stag horns and quite robust in full sun but they have become that way over a long period of time and they've hardened up . Uh but uh young ha stag horns uh th really you know they're th   th the best uh position is dappled shade under trees . And looking after them is  quite easy. They really don't mind just using the rain that falls and whatever falls into their lovely foliage sort of catchment  uh as fertiliser. You can every now and then shoot some seaweed up into them if they're up in a tree  um by clicking onto uh a seaweed uh thing onto the hose and just squirting it  because they do let those lovely foliage  um curved foliage take up the nutrient through the leaf . Um and the only other thing I would m be mindful of is the stag horn or elk horn beetle. That does a lot of damage . Uh and you can see it um eating through the the the big beautiful f um leaf uh foliages uh f with the stag horn beetle and the only thing that really nips that in the bud is using Confidor but I would just be mindful of that.\n"," Yes the other thing I have are possums.\n"," Oh.\n"," Do possums like stag horn.\n"," Not really.\n"," Oh good .\n"," Possums like other things like roses.\n"," I'm tried with possums all the time I've had  roses with it with a possum proof fence round them I'm hoping I'm going to get some .\n"," Well hopefully the r the possum won't go for the stag horn although if the possum's very hungry it probably  will um uh there are uh other plants that possums would prefer  magnolia buds rosebuds .\n"," Oh you're very encouraging . Thank you very much. Good.\n"," Thank you Pamela.\n"," other thing I must tell you which annoys me intensely I have an easement at the bottom of my garden and all this beautiful water going to waste down the drain.\n"," Yes luh uh I think everyone's sort of well anyone.\n"," you can do about it.\n"," There's  I've been listening to the government this week  talking about uh all of their solutions for water in this nation and this c in this beautiful city of ours. And I just think um y'know what all we can do as as home owners and and gardeners is capture as much of the rain that falls in our properties with a rainwater tank and use it on our garden and start at a grassroots level capture the uh s the rain um ih if you wanna divert that water flow ih um into a a a po a pool or something a pond um really um to yuh hook up the the roof uh with a water tank and see if we can capture as much as we can and then use that uh for our gardens I think that's just the easiest most simple idea and to know that that rebate for a rainwater tank has been extended to July two-thousand-and-eight where homeowners get six-hundred-and-fifty dollars rebate uh for installing a rainwater tank now there's so many wun wonderful tanks out there Pamela. Have you thought about that.\n"," Yes I am thinking about it yes indeed.\n"," I mean there's so many good dis uh tanks there's just the corrugated iron ones that look they're in a homestead out back  uh there's some slimline g rectangular tanks that actually fit down the side passages of our homes and driveways they're really very uh functional uh the other one I really like is a bladder system which I which operates as a an a a flexible bladder um and you can put it under the house or under a deck. It's Rain Reviver that's the company that does it and that means it's out of the way uh if it's hard y'know if you've got no space around your uh house these systems uh I think are absolutely ingenious and an an Australian invention I was looking up on the web uh last weekend that's Rain Reviver and they operate as big um like pillow shaped packages really that just open and contract and expand as the water goes in and you just flow the water in and then you can use it for whatever you need to the garden or or flushing the toilet or or uh or whatever. Uh uh a really wonderful Australian invention that's a bladder system from Rain Reviver but of course so many t types of rainwater tanks out there for us to choose from.\n"," Do you know what else there is now. Y you'll love this. If you're constructing a new home   walls and instead of having a concrete wall which is um ma maybe three hundred mils wide it's hollow  and it contains water.\n"," Using the cavity in the wall.\n"," How good is that.\n"," Terrific and I saw another one that the walls of a shed like a  garden shed were about a foot wide and they also were a reservoir for water as well a lot of people uh are using their brains to come up with very lateral ways of capturing water um on our gardens and I think if we can't um go forward uh as um um y'know it has been very o obvious from last week uh I think y'know gardeners can really make the solutions uh in their homes and in their gardens.\n"," It's a quarter to seven here at Two G B the Garden Clinic now if you lis listen very carefully between now and nine because   we'll be giving away uh thank you very much to um the f the people at Munns Munns quality garden products Australian owned since nineteen-forty-eight we have a golf course green lawn fertiliser five kilo bag two organic garden booster bags they're five kilos each the pack is worth fifty dollars we'll ask our Munns garden question between now and nine stay listening the first correct caller through when we give you a queue to call is today's winner.\n","\n","\n"," Hello Glad.\n"," Hello Luke hello Linda.\n"," Hello hello how are you.\n"," Fine thank you.\n"," That's good wha.\n"," Um my problem is um   tt uh pride of Madeira. It's the first year that I've had it that it's flowered.\n"," Wonderful how long has it taken to flower for Glad.\n"," Um well it's probably been in um oh perhaps twelve months.\n"," Oh well that's very lucky mine took four years to flower.\n"," Did it oh no  it hasn't been in that long. And uh now it's it's um   y'know it it has flowered and with this rain it's all droopy what do I do with it.\n"," Prune it back.\n"," Just prune.\n"," Prune all those flowerheads off I mean the pride of Madeira is just a favourite of mine for its stunning purple flowers. I mean some of them get about two foot long  and um and of course it's very drought tolerant a very waterwise plant doesn't need much water at all Mediterranean sort of plant  um like the lavenders and oh just stunning. But I would pr ih mine is droopy too um because of course they've got big heads of flowers and when they get wet they droop um just with the weight of the rain in them.\n"," And would I cut all those spikes.\n"," You can cut all those spikes back.\n"," Right  and it's next to a curl tree. Would their root systems.\n"," No they'll be fine together . Very happy together.\n"," Oh good.\n"," Thanks Glad.\n"," Thank you very much.\n"," I'm growing the tower of jewels uh pride of Madeira which I have to say maybe mum and dad mentioned it uh is probably three metres high with flower spikes about five foot long um uh unbelievable we're taking a photo and putting it into uh the magazine but it is probably three metres lo it's certainly taller than dad um so at least three metres tall uh and the flower spikes in excess of one metre tall unbelievable tower of jewels it's a a new variety of the pride of Madeira but certainly a big one for the garden let's go straight to Sally good morning.\n"," Good morning how are you today.\n"," Excellent how are you.\n"," Not too bad thank you.\n"," Good.\n"," Now before I start on what I wanted I heard you advertising the white cedar which I agree is a beautiful tree.\n"," Not advertising but just mentioning yes .\n"," Well mentioning right okay but but please may I warn any of your listeners who are thinking of investing in it that that the caterpillar that you mentioned   is a hairy brute and a lot of children are allergic to it. And it wanders into the house and you're likely to find its pupa uh c uh when it uh pupates before beforming the moth anywhere. And we had a terrible trouble because my nephew was allergic to it.\n"," Oh dear it can become a problem yes.\n"," It can be uh but if if they do as you said put the canvass around the thing   and kill them all off every morning   then you can keep the wretches down to control.\n"," Good . A pretty tree though.\n"," It's a beautiful tree I agree very pretty. And it's a light foliage it's not one of those very heavy dense.\n"," That's true.\n"," So you can grow other things underneath it.\n"," Exactly.\n"," And at this time of year you've got the very very pretty flowers but people need to don't put it outside the bedroom door of y bedroom window of your favourite son or you you'll wake him up itching in the middle of the night.\n"," Oh one for a property maybe.\n"," Well that's that's right or as ou out the front gate where the it can drop on the passers-by y'know.\n"," Yeah  a  good street tree.\n"," Naughty naughty aren't I. Okay now um what I was wanting to know is do you know anything about   pruning paw pawpaw trees.\n"," No why would you.\n"," Well I've got two and the um I'm looking out the back window now at the plain ordinary orange one which is five metres tall. And I cannot get the fruit .\n"," Oh dear.\n"," The possum's eaten half of half the big one.\n"," Yep.\n"," And I'm just going to try and recruit the friend up the street to bring his long ladder down as .\n"," Yes you need a a a sparky or someone or a chippie with a really long ladder.\n"," Well yes exactly but I'm just wondering what would happen if I chop it off will it shoot out again.\n"," It probably will but it's not uh um advisable.\n"," It's not advisable.\n"," No uh I mean there are smaller growing pawpaws to grow Sally and you  might like to get.\n"," It was just it was just from a seed.\n"," Yes well that's right but there are varieties.\n"," Mm see um I've got the um bisexual red and it's the same but fortunately it's right beside the garage so we can shin up on it and get .\n"," That's an im that's a very good thing a good solution plant it near a house or a t or a shed or something but no they're tall trees you can get smaller varieties and if you were looking for the s um named varieties I would definitely go to uh Daleys Fruit Tree Nursery or look them up on the web uh they're just the best Australian uh fruit nursery they do mail order and I'll just give you uh their email address um which is Emma at Daleys fruit dot com dot A U um Daleys spelt D A L E Y S and they specialise in subtropical fruit and nuts uh lots of pawpaws there uh macadamias herbs I mean terrific passion fruit custard apples avocadoes mangoes as well so if you're interested in subtropical fruit Daleys Fruit n Nursery is just wonderful it's at Kyogle but they do mail order and I'm sure they've got a smaller dwarf growing um pawpaw but uh I would not recommend a pruning.\n"," Three minutes to seven Two G B the Garden Clinic with Linda Ross.\n","\n","\n"," Good morning and welcome to another Sydney weekend Luke Bona here with Linda Ross and the Garden Clinic after nine as uh the man just said Sydney Real Estate with Mark Moraza and between ten and twelve today it is Your Health with Dr Graham a big line up today but Linda's here one-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number and.\n"," She'll do in the meantime.\n"," Listen can I can you quickly um answer this you'll do this in two seconds this is from Michelle   from Harrington Park. \n"," Oh. Okay new water. There is a fertiliser a liquid fertiliser Michelle that uh is actually named Lucky Bamboo and it's particularly for the water of the plant now it needs a really light bright spot as you can imagine ih something that's just growing in water needs a lot of uh sunshine to help photosynthesis and and good strong healthy growth. So I would go to my local nursery and I would buy the liquid fertiliser that's for lucky bamboo. They made one particularly for it because of course it's uh it's a soluble thing that's not it doesn't grow in in soil that's my first step um secondly I would put it in a really light bright sunshiny spot in the house so good luck with it I hope it uh   gets a little bit healthier in the next couple of weeks for you. Okay straight to Balgowlah good morning John.\n"," Good morning. Thanks very much for your show and I'm sure uh all all of your listeners enjoy it.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Uh my little problem is concerns a a   Tahitian lime which I put in that's about seven years old now  and uh buh as we're moving I've had to repot it I've pulled it out and it's now in a pot. Uh we've cut it back considerably  and some of the b some of the little branches are starting to die off and some are staying nice and green. Uh will you say what should I do. S s anything I can  help it with at all.\n"," Well the thing is it's probably in shock. 'Cos you've severed the roots.\n"," Yeah well that makes two of us.\n"," And unfortun uh was it a big big tree.\n"," Oh ih cuh about two metres.\n"," Yeah see that's quite  la and when was this done John.\n"," Oh about a month ago.\n"," Oh okay. Okay so what is what's happening is the tree has exploded into new growth probably like its sap's moving around and then you've come along and cut the roots. So it's just stressed out but what I would do in these situations when I'm transplanting anything out of the garden into a pot into a new spot um spray with Stress Guard. And it is uh um it covers the leaf and it stops the leaf from losing moisture. It basically stops moisture loss from transpiration uh really helpful uh at a time like this . What what it will do is dry out. Because the water uh ih it'll be stressed the roots actually can't take any moisture in and the leaves are giving moisture off so it's uh that's will ench eventually happen it'll dry out and die so the Stress Guard is very very good in this sort of situation when you're transplanting something not in autumn or winter  and uh and as an evergreen um plant of c ih it should be moved in autumn so we're a little bit late  but Stress Guard it. Which is a spray that you can spray over all of the leaves . Um and that stops any moisture being lost and that will help I would've liked that to be have done before you did it but now is still very good you'll get uh you ih will be very useful and just water the roots every week with seaweed solution.\n"," Uhuh that's the key one thanks very much.\n"," That's the key.\n"," Okay doke.\n"," Both of those now if you wanna hold on there John I'll send you out some Maxicrop  fr um which is a s wonderful seaweed solution uh so if you just hold on there  I'll get your address and we'll send you some Maxicrop because no n uh as well as as um you using the Maxicrop now while it's in a pot when it gets into its new location  it needs to be regularly watered with um s uh Maxicrop as well.\n"," Is it will it survive in a pot.\n"," It will survive in a pot a lot of Tahitian limes which I call the gin and tonic tree grow very well in big pots . So yes.\n"," Yes it's in a big one.\n"," Is it in a big pot.\n"," Fairly big yes.\n"," Something like a um eventually a half wine barrel is a  good size for  a a a Tahitian lime.\n"," Great.\n"," Okay . Terrific my pleasure John just remember also that uh citrus need to be fertilised three times a year they're very hungry uh but not for you right now let's wait till it gets a little bit better and it regenerates from it's uh huge shock and anyone else who's got citrus spring winter and autumn. Feed three times a year. Straight to Dorothy good morning Dorothy.\n"," Oh good morning Linda and Luke.\n"," Do they call you Dot.\n"," Y no really I'm a Dorothy Norman .\n"," Very good.\n"," She's a Dorothy Dorothy .\n"," Very good.\n"," How can we help you.\n"," I have a buffalo lawn in trouble.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Now it gets the sun all in summer all day but in winter about a quarter of it is mostly in shade . But it's always survived . Now this year I've had an absolute mat of weed in this area . I've dug it out but most of the buffalo is dead underneath  and the area seems to be almost rotted.\n"," Yes. The shade and the um the wi.\n"," water I suppose.\n"," That's right. D'y'know what I would think about doing Dorothy I know uh eh uh y'know I'd have liked the garden to be as easy and as trouble free as possible. The quarter is it under a tree that doesn't get the sun.\n"," No no it's some trees um from next door.\n"," Trees from next door. I would think about not having lawn there.\n"," Oh.\n"," Because it problem is gunna happen  year after year after year. The.\n"," Well this is the first year it's happened . I get a few weeds but I take them out and I never have any trouble.\n"," With the um the m harder um environment that we've gotta garden with now with the um the very dry winter we had with the druh well the drought really whether you wanna call it a drought or just y'know no rain . Na a natural sort of r um climatic condition that we have at the moment the lawn in that area will constantly each year um find it harder and harder to uh grow after the winter.\n"," What about the shade resistant buffalo.\n"," Shade tolerant buffalo is a good one  sh called Shademaster. But again complete shade over winter it will struggle to get back. Uh in in it's so hard to get mm a lawn growing in these areas but Shademaster is a terrific one but better in dappled shade obviously not full shade.\n"," Well it's not full shade.\n"," Okay . Well Shademaster is a great alternative.\n"," Now what about this mat of uh it almost looks like um uh well uh I suppose it's rotted dowh lawn and rotted weed. I've tried to scrape it up but it it looks as though it will need something a fungus spray or something on it.\n"," Well if it sounds like if if it's a whole lot of weeds and a whole loh um it it needs to be replaced.\n"," Yes I'll have to replace it.\n"," So maybe you would like to replace it um with the Shademaster uh lawns are it's it's such a hard thing I mean my I've totally relaxed my uh feelings of lawn I have because I am not prepared to water my lawn. Uh with the water restrictions and so it must stand up for itself so dad and I were laughing at it because it's more clover but I have the greenest sh c l I know that will horrify some of you lawn experts out there but it's a quite a green lawn I mow the lawh mow the clo clover and uh the dandelion and it's quite quite fine and uh of course I don't have to water it and it's n really nice and green so sometimes we have to l relax our feelings when it comes to lawn with the drought and uh the water restrictions. But in your case maybe now is time to replace it with a shade tolerant lawn like Shademaster.\n","\n","\n"," Lucky members for today the twenty-third and Mrs Elizabeth Disney.\n"," What a cute name.\n"," Related to Walt Disney.\n"," Who knows.\n"," Possibly not.

Now my neighbour tells me you've gotta wait for seven years but I see trees that look smaller than mine  it must be about eight foot now  and and and they've got flowers on them so can I do anything or is it a dud.\n"," Not really and don't know .\n"," Oh right dih buy another one.\n"," Very hard to know  um at the nursery they do um you do buy uh guaranteed to flower plants  now I mean all nurseries should be um gr um selling um plants that are guaranteed to flower . Uh that's just y'know uh absolutely given when you buy a jacaranda. If you had um propagated a jacaranda from seed  I would say yes seven years to flower and maybe never  but because you have bought it from the nursery I'd say ih there's a hundred percent um chance that it will flower.\n"," Oh uh oh eventually.\n"," Eventually . And it might take a couple of.\n"," no idea of the time it.\n"," Not not really I mean sometimes a a jacaranda takes seven years uh to feel comfortable enough to flower . But um uh and um and sometimes those ones that you see that are flowering young ones.\n"," Yes.\n"," They've been in a pot for a long time . So what they think they ac they actually trick themselves into thinking that they're older than they are because their root space is completely taken up with roots . And uh a plant uh oh ov often will fruit and flower when it's in a pot because it feels like it's mature  'cos there's no more space for the roots  to grow.\n"," Don't chop it down .\n"," No I I'd give it a couple more years Nora.\n"," Alright  thanks Linda.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Bye.\n"," Bye-bye and gee I can just see a mauvy tint across the uhs the city this week as the jacarandas are just about to burst into flower absolutely my favourite time of the year because it coincides with my birthday ha ha but if you'd like to join us on the jacaranda cruise you can we've got three beautiful cruises to celebrate jacarandas and Sydney um ring nine-four-eight-four-five-one-hundred if you wanna join the Ross family on the harbour for three hours stuff yourself with uh muffins and have a cup of tea with us that's coming up in November. Straight to Baulkham Hills Dorothy good morning.\n"," Um this is the first time I've ever rung  I listen every weekend.\n"," Thank you for listening  Dorothy.\n"," Having problems with my b well I'm not problems with my blue potato vine.\n"," Oh wonderful thing to grow we don't really talk about it much.\n"," No this is why I've been listening to see if someone else has .\n"," I'm glad  you've plucked up the courage to ring.\n"," Last year it was absolutely this was its first year it was perfect I had beautiful clumps of blue flowers.\n"," Mhm.\n"," And followed by the.\n"," Berry.\n"," Berries and they were magnificent. But now I let it go in the winter time because I didn't know what to do about it and now I'm wondering should I be pruning it or should I.\n"," When did it flower for you.\n"," Um.\n"," Autumn.\n"," No  not theh not this year it must have been   uh earlier on much earlier on.\n"," Uh summer this year.\n"," Mm yes it would've been summer.\n"," Oh okay um what could it be uh they do flower summer and autumn  and then that's wh as soon as they finish flowering Dorothy that's when to prune them.\n"," And how how far do you .\n"," Well you can you can be as tough as you like really.\n"," Yes well it it looks scraggly at the moment.\n"," Exactly.\n"," And I thought now should I.\n"," I wouldn't prune it now . It's too late for this year . Uh and uh that's fine blue potato vine and 'n' Solanums often get straggly. Uh that's just their nature they're looking for the sun and they're straggly and leggy and.\n"," Well it gets plenty of sun.\n"," Yeah that's why it's looking for the sun it goes out and it lengthens. Uh that's the a little bit of an issue when when growing potato vines but when it stops flowering um in s autumn summer and autumn next year two-thousand-and-five then you can prune quite hard.\n"," And do I feed it now or.\n"," Um definitely feed it now spring is a wonderful time to feed Dorothy and really whatever you've got will be right for a potato vine whether it's Organic Life or Garden Gold anything for a potato vine now and that will encourage more flowers and then a really hard prune after flowering.\n"," Dorothy thank you for your call we do have to move on twenty-seven past seven Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," Yes Luke and Linda this morning in the Garden Clinic and we're still waiting for Mrs E Mansfield from Mt Warrigal Miss Tamara Barinov from Woollahra Miss uh Mrs Thelma Hayes from Redfern we've heard from Elizabeth Disney and Lee Zorbis so they're our final three members on the Garden Clinic please call us on one-three-hundred-seven-double-two-eight-seven-three and pick up your prize which is some Yates Pest Oil. But remember you can also contact the Garden Clinic today. The office is open today 'n' you can join the Garden Clinic uh and Linda your telephone number there.\n"," And   nine-four-eight-four-five-one-hundred thank you so much for joining us here on the Garden Clinic show uh Linda and Luke with you uh lovely to have your company on a warm Saturday love the weekend I love when it rolls around oh we can just take a load off make a nice cup of calming tea and look out to the lovely garden see how it's spruced up with the recent spring rains. I hope your garden's looking a treat let's go out to Laurie Kirrawee and see what her garden's looking like.\n"," Oh  water-shod . But I'm so glad to see the sun.\n"," Fr it's good isn't it . How can how can we help what are you doing today.\n"," Well uh I have a Christmas bush uh at the moment it's in full white bloom. It's in a pot about oh.\n"," A n a New South Wales Christmas bush.\n"," Yes.\n"," Yep  not the New Zealand yep.\n"," yeah ih it's the one that turns  red after  it's in a pot about fourteen inches across . I want to put it out into the garden but the only problem is uh the soil is quite clay . Now can I successfully leave it in the pot  uh oh I'd rather I mean it's about a a metre and a half tall . A and I I would like to get it out into the garden  but I don't quite know how to go about it.\n"," Well let me just firstly say if you put it in the garden now it will die . The clay soil it hates clay soil.\n"," Oh I know.\n"," So you've got to um build up the soil into a mound with really good compost and soil and um uh a bit of a proportion of sand because you can see where the New South Wales Christmas bush grow they grow right along the Hawkesbury sandstone areas where the soils is quite skeletal but quite well drained.\n"," Yeah well it came from uh my son's garden in Frenchs Forest.\n"," Yeah perfect there you go  exactly. That's the perfect spot for it Frenchs Forest the soils are so well drained there so what you've gotta do is replicate that . Mound up the soil so the water drains away. Put a lot of cow manure to m to break down that clay use Clay Breaker and GroundBreaker or gr uh GroundBreaker which breaks down the clay for you . And even if you want import a little bih uh I normally say don't import topsoil make it yourself but with really heavy clay uh import topsoil uh uh into a mound  um so you've got a nice mounded garden bed plant the Christmas bush at the top and you can put other things like kangaroo paw or whatever you wish around it .\n"," Well 'cos the place where I'm going to put it uh I've had a several mm uh layers of uh sugarcane mulch  over the years ih in that garden 'cos it's where I have all my bulbs as well . A and uh uh like uh that can be dug in I've found that that t tended to mat a bit on top of the soil.\n"," It does mat . Um like any mulch does um but yes you can build that in hmhm \n"," Yeah well I don't want to lose it . Uh how long could I leave it in the pot that it's in.\n"," How long .\n"," it's about two year old.\n"," See and it's flowering well.\n"," Oh ih it's covered in flower.\n"," Wonderful well then I would probably just leave it there until the area um is at to your satisfaction . Till the soil is friable and well drained enough for you to think it's gunna grow and the water will drain away . That's that's when.\n"," Have I got uh t time for just another quick.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Uh I have an apricot tree. I grew it from seed uh and it's about three year old. Now for the first two years it did produce fruit but this year uh I've only got about two or three  apricots on it. Would that be because of the drought.\n"," Exactly.\n"," Mhm.\n"," Yeah it's just a little s water stress like so many of the other fruit trees we're getting a lot of problems with fruit trees when they're stressed fruit trees just uh either are susceptible to a lot of insect to rot uh and disease uh and uh when uh they're water stressed particularly that's ih that's evident and they oh often don't fruit so that's all it is Laurie. If your apricot which I think is amazing that firstly you've germinated from seed and secondly that it fruited for you in the first three years is incredible let's just have a little hiatus this year and uh just feed it well at the moment y'know some fruit tree fertiliser and let's wait uh for it to fruit next year lovely to talk to you though and good to get that New South Wales Christmas bush in as soon as you can as soon as you've improved that soil. Uh let's go to Oatlands and speak with Nicky.\n"," Good morning good morning to you both.\n"," How are you.\n"," Not too bad thank you.\n"," Excellent.\n"," Um just calling about my lawn it is buffalo it's not a huge area it's it's a really quite a large court yeahr court y'know area  I suppose you could say. Uh north facing. The lawn is in great condition but we have a lot of weeds mainly binh bindy  and and and also this other oh I it's a green on top and it's like silver underneath and I'm digging those out like there's no tomorrow but   yeah they just keep coming back so I just wanted y'know .\n"," Well you've got a broad leaf grass  which means you can't use any of the weedicides on it.\n"," That's r yeah that's my problem.\n"," But I mean having said that a buffalo's the best lawn to have anyway  it's so easy. And looks good most of year . Um so I'd definitely get some Bindii onto the bindy . Um it's a little bit late because they're actually forming um now but uh a little bit of Bindii will help  um and y'know all you can do really is either dig it out by hand  which I always find the best way because you get the root system  and it's all gone and you can just y'know get your little knee pad out there take the t the radio and  off you go um and you know that they're all gone and then give you a fertil um then you give your lawn a little bit of a a feed to m make it all knit into the holes again . Uh a good healthy lawn will um be so thick that weeds find it hard to get in and.\n"," I have noticed that lately actually  that.\n"," But then lately I mean goodness luh mm goodness me it's a lawn  it's very y'know we've got water restrictions  we can't keep watering our lawns  y'know that's just fact um so a f if a few little weeds get in l like you've got get them out with a little wuh um hand weeder  or use um a specialised herbicide like uh Roundup or Zero. A.\n"," Yeah the only thing is have a little one who's just nearly two .\n"," Well I wouldn't use that either then  uh and dogs as well I would just hand weed  get out there um spend half a day get get them all out and particularly the bindi-eye with her around  you know you wanna get rid of that on uh as as soon as possible but un unfortunately there's no magic solution I wish there was . I wish I would sell it  um but unfortunately I can't it's just a a matter of hand weeding getting them all out and unfortunately it's a little bit of y'know a process that will go on and on as weed seeds blow in  from neighbours and so forth it's really hard to protect our lawn against weeds . But a healthy lawn um thick and healthy  uh and uh now is the time to feed them of course  um really helps because if it's thick lawn the weed seeds find it hard to uh penetrate  and to grow.\n"," Yep no that's great thanks very much for your help.\n"," Thank you.\n"," Thank you bye.\n"," Bye-bye.\n"," Thirteen to eight here at Two G B we'll take a break coming back with more of the Garden Clinic more of your calls lawn tips around the corner   and uh I got a couple of emails here that you might want to address I'll let you look at them during the break Linda  this is Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," Well lawns are growing at a hectic pace aren't they huh hard to get um hard to get them trimmed uh my lawn is oh up to my knees  already. It's the worst um it's it's the tallest lawn in in the whole neighbourhood uh I'm sure people hate my lawn but when you are mowing and I as I am this afternoon yeah just keep it a little bit higher um with the um uh with the less rain we're getting it's important just to have a a little bit higher lawn about two inches three inches l um high uh and that will really help protect it and of course if you mulch mow um that's really important too to mulch the lawn as you go 'n' and that really helps conserve root moisture uh so just a couple of tips there when you're mowing your lawn.\n"," Good on you Linda let's get back to calls Maurice good morning.\n"," Good morning .\n"," Hello Maurice.\n"," How are you.\n"," Good how are you.\n"," Oh not bad.\n"," How can I help.\n"," Look I've got a mango tree about fifteen years old.\n"," Yes.\n"," And two year ago I had a lot of mango . Last year I didn't have one even. But now there's a lot of flower on it do you think I should spray it with something or.\n"," No I think you should just leave it unfortunately now it's rained. And that's a loh uh that's a problem um when uh the weather is rainy you ih um sometimes it washes all the pollen away.\n"," Ah yes.\n"," That's the problem with m m passion fruits too if anyone's growing passion fruits  because we've had the uh autumn uh sorry the October rains  which month am I in October rains um you you do need to hand pollinate with a small brush f um that's the passion fruit but all I would do for you m Morrie is really just see how that mango goes I mean it's hard to pollinate a tree uh 'cos they're too tall um but yeah.\n",".\n"," Sorry w what was that.\n"," It's a big tree .\n"," Big tree that's right yes and you can't really do anything to increase your production and it's unfortunately um with the season that's we have   sometimes it rains when the um the the mangoes are pollinating the the rain washes the pollen away so you don't get the the flowers pollinated and that turning into fruit unfortunately the the climate can be against you so we can just cross our fingers and hope that your flowers have already pollinated themselves before we got the rain from last week.\n"," So just leave it alone Maurice that's the uh advice from Linda let's move on then there's Robin from Londonderry.\n"," Hi.\n"," Good morning.\n"," Hello.\n"," Linda good morning Luke how are you.\n"," We're good thanks.\n"," I'm ringing this morning about my roses  my climbing roses but before I start can I just quickly say something about those beautiful white cedar trees.\n"," Yes.\n"," Which I have some in my driveway and.\n"," Have you.\n"," I have one in the house. But I was given them under the name of a cape lilac.\n"," Really.\n"," Which I thought that was lovely  flowers are so beautiful however why I'm ringing is   I've learned during a a course at TAFE actually that these um berries are so toxic to horses  they'll kill them within twenty-four hours.\n"," Yes that's a real problem.\n"," And I just thought that maybe everybody might like to know that so that if they are planting then uh luckily I didn't plant them in the horse paddock.\n"," Oh 'cos you're out that way.\n"," could have been disastrous.\n"," Horses and cattle uh they're very toxic to  um but you them um they're perfect for a street tree whe .\n"," Oh look they're the most beautiful canopy .\n"," But yes that's right they are toxic.\n"," so wonderful . But to get onto my roses  I have climbing roses on the front fence those white cherokee roses which  have got terribly um   y'know straggly  especially with the drought and y'know not having too much to to give them up there on the street but  I want to know um somebody said I shouldn't cut them back till after they flower and they're only just starting to look like wanting to flower now . Is it right that I leave it till after they  flower  and how far how hard can .\n"," Oh Robyn you can be ruthless.\n"," Okay .\n"," When the kids are annoying you get out there with the secateurs and  take all your anger out on the climbing rose. Now the thing with climbing roses and uh I was at a wonderful garden gee it was pretty. Helen's garden um I duh guh uh landscape design consultation in Pymble last week  and she had this climbing rose and it was a couple of years old and it was a tangled mess and I said give me the secateurs and we untangled it we were very ruthless with it Robyn  um anything that we didn't want we removed . Um a lot of laterals we removed and we then um untangled these this this sort of wild mess of of stems.\n"," Well that's how mine have got on the  on street line .\n"," Right and then we just.\n"," Want them to be y'know cover you from the street a little bit  however they get to the point where they're not .\n"," That's right and what you want to do after flowering is prune all those laterals back to your framework. And it's so important to uh get that frame work up and running so it looks good it's um w we had uh a some posts of the pergola we were winding them up in a sort of clockwork uh clockwise direction they just looked good in so good in in the end but that's what you need to do prune back the laterals to your framework and then you'll get wonderful new growth and new flowers next year.\n"," Have to leave it there Robyn thank you for your call and thanks for the warning about those bushes and the b and the and the horses very good advice. Four minutes to eight this is Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," Luke and Linda this morning um back to you callers in just a second there is an email there that um ih it's a er a problem with a swimming pool and cocos time I believe.\n"," It is Luke thank you very much for passing this over she has got rid of the cocos palms around her pool yay and uh she'd like some uh replacements something with a little bit of fragrance um.\n"," Don't you just hate cocos palms  I've got those four hideous ones outside they drop those y yellow berries  in any wind  the pa the palms come down.\n"," Yeah and then their fronds hang bluh uh like dead because they don't drop the fronds.\n"," Why did we go through this cocos palm.\n"," It was some crazy nurseryman and I feel like hunting him down . But  uh from the seventies but he's probably gone now  God rest his soul. But no y'know what   palms are quite lovely and the bangalow palm is a very pretty self cleaning palm. Stop laughing. Um m the bangalow palm it's an Australian palm and it's just beautiful they do get taller and I'm not suggesting you replace uh the cocos with bangalows but in an in a sort of a tropical setting bangalow palms do grow quite well and they're a good b uh palm for cooler climates so if you're out um out in the western suburbs and you want to create that tropical sort of a feel uh bangalow palms are definitely the one for you and in cooler weather they sort of get s a bit stunted so they don't grow as quickly. They're really lovely a s a lovely clean trunk the fronds drop off um they're not big fronds so don't worry it's not gunna hurt anyone but they drop off when they die so they're nice and clean uh and lovely uh and look after themselves. Uh okay so now let's get back Marilyn's qu query. Marilyn it just I just want to know really what height you want these things around the salt water pool. Uh you um if you wanted um taller things around the salt water pool um like a a medium sized tree then an evergreen uh native frangipani would be great uh I just don't know what height you want I mean gardenias are terrific on on a lower level the perfume of a gardenia um in a medium level like a two to three metre level the Magnolia grandiflora little gem. In a sunny spot it just flowers nonstop for ten months of the year and its big white flowers have a a lemon fragrance. Uh that's beautiful uh now uh and if you wanted something taller the native frangipanis a hymenosporum. They're flowering their little heads off at the moment. You'll see them all around Sydney they've got lemon yellow flowers they're a small to medium size tree but quite a fine looking tree not a dense tree so it won't throw a lot of shade and just p oh just a profusion of uh lemon uh flowers right now with a beautiful fragrance. Uh just lovely and a really glossy green leaf too which goes with that tropical sorta look. So I hope that helps and if you um would like to be more specific with the height I'll hih uh I'll help you even further.\n"," Eleven past eight let's go back to calls Anne from Blacktown good morning.\n","\n","\n"," Thanks Anne for your call. To Winifred good morning.\n"," Good morning.\n"," Hi Winifred.\n"," Hi thank you I'm an avid fan of the Rosses.\n"," Thank you darling.\n"," I enjoy you all. Tell me uh I'm ringing for my daughter she's in Bellevue Hill and her face ow uh house is facing north  and the frontage is a wide long frontage and she's got two will have two wide brick spaces now in that she wishes to put shrubs smaller ones in one lot and taller in the other . I'm very fond of uh oh camellias and gardenias but what do you suggest.\n"," Well camellias and gardenias are terrific plants and in a northerly position that she has there I would love to see what sort of house she has. Uh a photo would be terrific and then I would be able to maybe suggest things that would bring out the colour of the house or would suit the  style of the house.\n"," Stone mostly.\n"," Stone.\n"," And there will be stone colour.\n"," And a stone colour so like that ochry colour.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Well y'know and uh.\n"," storeys.\n"," Two storeys  and uh so I mean the camellias are terrific um particularly the sasanquas as you know fr Winifred would like the  hot sun. Now um gardenias um would be good as well as long as they're not getting any of the western sun.\n"," No it she's facing north.\n"," But then accent  plants too would be great.\n"," Which ones.\n"," Accent plants plants with strappy leaves like Cordyline red sensation. These are terrific they make great statements and they give a really lovely sort of accent in the garden they really draw your attention because a good garden design should have lots of different textures and leaf shapes. That's what makes it interesting so you've got the small leaf shape of the camellias and then a really interesting strappy leaf shape of a Cordyline red sensation. Or there's a new one called pink sensation now red sensation has burgundy coloured leaves really great looking thing. Tough and hardy and I love it when I plant it with flapjacks underneath because the flapjacks have a burgundy margin to the leaf which picks it up really well and sometimes I like planting it with agaves as well so you get this really good little feel. What are you looking at me like that for you think I'm on a r tangent a raving and ranting but that's what we need to do when we're designing gardens from scratch is get into a little bit of a r rave work out what colours uh and match the colours with other things use foliage plants as well as flowering plants and then you'll have a sensational garden so I would suggest Winifred for her to look at the Cordyline red sensation for her to look at uh flapjacks uh and agaves which are those century plants wonderful statements and then maybe the hedge of Camellia sasanqua at the back.\n"," Thank you for your call. You shuh you you were getting worked up.\n"," Oh well a new garden's always exciting isn't it.\n"," And we've got some garden news with Rodian right  after this.\n"," Absolutely.\n","\n","\n"," Well all bush gardeners all fern lovers and all lovers of Australian plants listen up there's been a new discovery in Queensland very interesting and to tell us a little bit more about it Rodian Booker from the Garden Clinic good morning.\n"," Good morning Linda how you going.\n"," I'm not too bad rolling through the morning. Tell us about what they found in and Queensland and and what that means for home gardeners.\n"," Well it's a um a variety of um tassel fern blue tassel fern uh Huperzia. It's a.\n"," A what . A.\n"," Huperzia.\n"," Huperzia mhm.\n"," Yeah um   often sold as a hanging basket plant or other varieties of it have been makes a stunning um specimen for the shade house and under trees. But they've found one in Queensland that was last recorded in the wild about twenty-six years ago. And it was thought to be extinct.\n"," Unbelie and where in Queensland.\n"," Uh location's being kept a secret at the moment .\n"," Oh it's a bit like the Wollemi pine.\n"," Very similar yeah. Yeah it's quite a significant discovery because um they've found that an extract of the plant was um useful in treating um or improving cognitive thought process. More efficiently than current supplements like ginkgo and that sort of thing.\n"," Good 'n' that I wuh I'd love a bit of that.\n"," Rodian  are you  uh Rodian uh Rodian are you near another telephone. There's a bit of interference there.\n"," Uh no I'm not actually.\n"," Anyway keep going  that's bett that's better.\n"," Now why do they call it blue Rodian.\n"," Um it's got a slight glaucous uh sorta coating on the foliage. Uh and the r and the rest of the genus is quite a bright um healthy looking green.\n"," W oh wow so this is different to the and it's a blue tassel fern now when do they think I mean obviously a new discovery hasn't been seen for a while thought to be extinct when do they think it will be available for home gardeners. I wanna get  me some.\n"," Well the um pharmaceutical benefit should ensure that the propagation gets  underway as soon as possible uh and they're hoping to get it out into garden centres I'd imagine within a couple of years. But they're not a speedy plant to grow and so not the easiest to propagate so  it could take some time.\n"," Extracting the pharmaceutical benefits would be hard I mean w uh would it be available in a capsule form or or uh. Is it the  is it the foliage  that has it.\n"," There is one species in the genus that comes from China the plants come from sort of   um all over Asia and we've got nine species here including the blue one. Um the one from China is being s there's a capsule at the moment. But they've under undergoing trials to  um our native varieties are   uh as beneficial.\n"," So more effective than than than uh ginkgo huh I need.\n"," ginkgo  how do you know.\n"," I need to improve my memory well thank you for that it's always wonderful I think to hear of uh an Australian new discovery there's um like the the Wollemi pine we just get so excited when we know that there's things that are out there that haven't been touched and to know that it has pharmaceutical benefits like so many of the plants around the world that haven't been found we just don't know what we've got until someone goes out and finds it for us so thank you very much.\n"," There he goes Rodian thank you for that have a good day.\n"," With the blue tassel fern very interesting more potent than the ginkgo biloba good for memory I'll certainly be looking out for that one.\n","\n","\n"," Noel good morning. Noel.\n"," Hi Noel.\n"," Hello.\n"," How are you.\n"," Good thanks.\n"," That's good.\n"," Good Luke is it.\n"," It's Luke yes and how's your memory.\n"," Now I've got a proper one for you.\n"," Oh right what.\n"," Now this belongs to the uh bird of paradise plant. And it's called   all I can find out is nickname   uh sexy Lynne.\n",".\n"," I knew it. I knew it.\n"," Are you serious.\n"," No I am that's all I can find out about it but it's a beautiful flower. I've seen it.\n"," Is it pink.\n"," Sorta p uh pink and white I think it was.\n"," Yeah.\n"," It was about twelve months or so it's turned and I've been trying to find out everywhere where do you get them.\n"," Well d'y'know what I think it is. I think it's a h um oh duh duh duh I think it's a crab's claw a heh Heliconia.\n"," A what.\n"," A Heliconia.\n"," Uh now hulih.\n"," Hih huh lu okay Heliconia um heh uh H E L.\n"," H E L.\n"," E  C O   E C O I N uh.\n"," Too fast for me.\n"," Right  H E L E C.\n"," S C.\n"," E C.\n"," E C.\n"," O N.\n"," O N.\n"," I A.\n"," I A.\n"," I A and it's Heliconia  um does the l did the flower drop down.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Okay now the this is sexy pink is uh also it's another name I'm very happy th to know that it's called sexy Lynne . That makes me  quite a a happy yeah sexy pink it it's also known  in the florist industry. Now a lot of florists um use it and they sell it about twenty dollars for a a a  flower stem . It is a tropical plant Noel so it is very difficult to grow in Sydney. It I have seen it growing in gardens in Cairns and Darwin um when I do our Cairns our north uh north Queensland tropical duh tour we see it in gardens all over the shop it's a Heliconia ih very closely related as you say to the birds of paradise. Um thah ih sometimes they call them crab's claws now you can grow a couple of Heliconias in Sydney my friend Robyn has one called Heliconia rostrata which is a red flowering Heliconia crab's claw in a very hot um sunny courtyard with the western sun and reflected heat from the surrounding walls that's the sort of microclimate you need Noel to find it now you're not gunna find it for sale in Sydney you might find it for sale in mel um Brisbane. Uh so let's have a lookout and see if we've can find it we can do a little search in the nurseries in Brisbane but unfortunately uh it's a little bit too south here in Sydney to grow the Heliconia sexy Lynne or sexy pink but thanks for bringing it to our attention Noel and uh hope you have a wonderful weekend in the garden.\n","\n","\n"," One-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number straight back to calls in the Garden Clinic Nicky good morning.\n"," Yeah hi um guys thanks very much for your program it's great.\n"," Thanks for ringing in Nicky.\n"," That's okay um I've got a question we laid um some sir Walter turf just before the heat wave.\n"," Yep.\n"," It was looking rather dodgy so we Seasoled it a couple of times. And then we had all the rain. And then  because we'd had some sewerage pipework done in February we ended up with a trench right down the middle of our turf.\n"," Buh yeah.\n"," So we've had to repair it we repaired it yesterday but what I was wondering was should I Seasol it again uh we have got a watering permit and should I start watering it again even though we've had all that rain.\n"," No.\n"," No.\n"," Oh   yes.  no yes how  what  if y h you had to t take it out and then put it in.\n"," We had to roll the turf back  over the trench.\n"," Oh yes  water water with the seaweed.\n"," Water so today.\n"," Yep  even though it's rained  um the roots will be um will have sort of broken up a little bit and they  do need to uh to be repaired  and the best way to repair roots is with the seaweed solution so just water in that strip the seaweed and get all those roots to knit back together . Uh and that will happen very quickly particularly in this weather Nicky.\n"," Okay so um what's the difference between that Charlie Carp and the Seasol.\n"," Well um in well Charlie Carp's not seaweed.\n"," Oh isn't it . Oh that's the fish stuff.\n"," It's just mushed up  Charlie carps  from the rivers which is great all for all um plants really and uh the whole garden but really the seaweed is what you need  because that's what's g uh the vitamins and the minerals in it  that will help something um you sorta just get back into health after being uh shocked and  sort of m.\n"," Yeah it's a tonic for plants.\n"," That's it.\n",".\n"," That you're a good girl . I might send you some . How about I send you some.\n"," Oh that'd be great.\n"," I'll send you some Maxicrop um to help you but how um it will take a couple of weeks to get to you Nicky  but um it will help in the long term and just uh y'know gyee uh water that strip in and get that to knit knit back together. Uh hold on the line we'll send you back to Daisy we'll get your uh address and we'll send you some more Maxicrop out. A good seaweed solution that one.\n"," Good on ya Nicky stay right there it's nineteen minutes to nine we'll take another call in just a second but it is prize time. Now earlier in the program we spoke to Rodian about something rather special. And rather secret.\n"," We did and it was just found in deepest darkest Queensland we don't know what   or we don't know ooh we do know what   and that's the question but we don't know where uh what was uh the little plant that has been rediscovered hasn't been seen for twenty-eight years and it has very interesting cognitive memory um uh.\n"," Benefits.\n"," Benefits.\n"," One th I  I just I just thought I'd remind you there. One-three-hundred-s . You ih you need some one-three-hundred-seven-double that was perfect one-three-hundred-seven-double-two-eight-seven-three is the number and  the first caller through has won the Munns bag it's a it's a golf course green lawn fertiliser five kilo bag.\n"," I tell you who needs that.\n"," Two organic garden booster kih five kilo bags and the pack is worth fifty dollars thanks to Munns quality garden products Australian owned since nineteen-forty-eight.\n"," Mark Mark Moraza needs that.\n"," He why.\n"," He just y'know he got ih he just he just arrived and he's upset at me . Because I was bagging lawn lovers and saying you know just relax with the lawn he's saying you can't relax with your lawn. He's so uptight about the lawn he feeds it nearly every week . He goes all of guys love their lawn so don't bag .\n"," And we mow it and we mow it in a pattern.\n"," It it oh  you've got your special way of mowing have you boys.\n"," You have your special way you do y w your pattern and you leave us alone.\n"," And then he asked me why would he bother with an organic lawn food. Because he just wants a green lawn he doesn't really care and I said well y'know y you have to worry about the the waterways and our river systems and he goes I don't care and then I thought y'know what I'm gunna put it differently. 'Cos he's out on his boat and he wants to catch a fish I said well y'know what   if you use an organic food you'll be able c catch more fish on that lovely boat of yours and that's I think actually changed his mind.\n"," He has enough trouble ry not running it into rocks let alone  catching fish eighte I I've been there eighteen to nine hi Anita.\n"," Hello good morning.\n"," Hello.\n"," I have a terrible problem.\n"," Oh dear.\n"," Um I had planted my olive trees about a year ago. Yeah sorta about a year ago and they just come up beautiful had all new growth.\n"," Mhm. What's happened to them.\n"," All the new growth died off it's looks like somebody went over with it uh with a   weed killer . All my olive trees are it's just frightening. Now.\n"," When was this.\n"," maybe it was that really hot day and then  really cold. I dunno.\n"," Well why don't you just give them a little tip prune.\n"," A tip prune.\n"," Tip prune a little light prune all over uh and uh it might've been that very hot day we had last week or the week before uh temperatures uh particularly out at Toongabbie oh remember how hot it was. It was like thirty-five  thirty-eight-point-two thank you Luke. S trust you to remember such an interesting piece of trivia yeah so uh that would've been it ol um uh I was just about to call you Olive Anita those olive trees just coming into the spring season got a little bit burnt just tip prune it water with the seaweed solution and let's geh uh encourage a little bit more growth um with those olives and you can even feed at this time too spring is a good time to feed olive trees and don't worry at all it would've just been a little response to that hot day.\n"," Thank you for your call sixteen to nine Two G B.\n","\n","\n"," fish markets. Lorraine good morning.\n"," Hello. Um hi Luke  look I hah I live at Rouse Hill I have been given a lilac tree.\n"," Yes.\n"," And I'm not sure quite how big it grows like where could I plant it. We get a lot of uh westerly sun.\n"," Yeah okay well the lilacs probably won't like the westerly sun and they really do need the the cold climate . So uh um I mean suh just plant it um in a sunny spot.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Um perhaps uh a little bit shaded by the westerly sun it grows to about two six foot two metres tall  and um not a very thick tree but uh and particularly not in um around Sydney. Um but it it will grow it's m a very cold climate thing Lorraine but it will grow there's a good article on how to grow lilac in this y um this spring edition of the Garden Clinic magazine uh how to grow lilac uh which is great written by Sandra. But yeah two metres high plant it in an area that's um a little bit shaded from the westerly sun and off you go 'n' well rotted well good good soils. Nutritious soils and good drainage of course.\n"," Could you put it in a uh in a large pot.\n"," Well you could. Better in the ground.\n"," Better in the ground.\n"," Yeah 'cos it just gets too hot in a pot the the the  it's the cold climate thing and the roots will get too hot and it probably won't like it so much when it's in the ground of course its roots tend to be much cooler.\n"," Okay.\n"," Thanks  for your call.\n"," Thank you bye.\n"," I just got an email from Marie. Uh and she says oh I need some help with my lemon tree it's infested with citrus gall wasp uh so yes uh have a look out for that lumpy growth everyone uh on young leaf stems and midribs uh and even the fruit stalks of citrus tree it's cau um caused by citrus uh gall wasp. Uh and most citrus are attacked but grapefruit and rough lemons are the more most susceptible and and of course Marie's got it on her lemon. You do need to remove all the stems that have that affected um w uh gall uh unsightly gall g um growing and repeated attacks can weaken the tree and then of course they're uh unproductive so remove all the galls buh um from the trees place the galls in a plastic bag seal the bag and put it in the garbage. Don't put it in the compost um because you'll just spread it all around so yes try and get on to that as soon as possible and I I would do it this weekend.\n"," Judy good morning.\n"," Yes hi.\n"," Hi Judy . Where are you.\n"," sorry I had the phone on loudspeaker I was mopping the floors whilst I was waiting . Trying to make the most of my Saturday morning.\n"," Multitasking that's what I like in a girl.\n"," That's right. Um look my problem is my puppy. I adore him but   he's a dog that eats absolutely everything . Um he's a jack russell he destroys my camellias 'cos he loves their roots and he loves to eat them he eats the dynamic lifter   even digs into the ground and eats it and he's survived it of all things. But I have bindy all though my grass and I have been hand weeding it  but it just takes so long 'cos I think I have every weed   possible in my lawn um and it's taking so long and the one thing I can put up with everything apart from the bindi-eye.\n"," Yes I can too ah  again nothing really uh that is safe I would just ue uh unless you wanna s spray with Bindii and keep him off it for a a week which is  sometimes difficult but yeah probably a weekend or uh or a week um I'd say y'know five days keep him off. Uh you could use the Bindii or again.\n"," Would a weekend be sorry for interrupting would a weekend be sufficient  'cos it means I've actually gotta board him.\n"," I know. Um there's no real answer for that one I mean as long as possible Judy is all I can say.\n"," Okay.\n"," Um and the yeah uh otherwise just keep with the hand weeding just keep him off as long as possible . And obviously do it on a hot day if you can and as soon as possible because they're growing at a at a great rate.\n",". 'N' can I slip in one other thing.\n"," Yep.\n"," At the moment he's actually sitting on top of my parsley and my um strawberries and my mint.\n"," How old is he.\n"," Oh he's nine months and he  sits on top of it and he eats my strawberries. And he eats the chives . Is there anything to discourage them. Or is there anything I could plant with them that .\n"," No a big smack and .\n"," And he's just chomped into anoth he's another beautiful .\n"," When I had my two puppies my two cattle dogs they got into a lot of trouble Judy  uh and they had big smacks on their rear ends and uh and also I had a lot of uh I did put a bamboo fencing all around my garden I made this bamboo from lengths of bamboo and I just stuck them all in it didn't have to be that high because young puppies y'know they don't really jump that m high when they're young but I did use bamboo and I fenced all my garden beds particularly my vegie patch and my herbs. And I just made a little gate I wired it all up myself it took a weekend but ih in the end it dog-proofed my garden. Uh I trained the dogs after a while and they are impeccably trained now. Uh they won't even go into the garden they won't even walk into the garden they're just such good dogs it does take a while it does take that th fen to to build the fence so they know where they're allowed and where they're not. Uh and th that's what I did and uh and then just a little smack every time they go in or a squirt with water as Dr Harry says when they're doing something naughty a little squirt with water in their face.\n"," Thanks for your call Judy we do have to move awa uh along it's eight minutes to nine back with more calls in just a sec.\n","\n","\n"," Maureen good morning.\n"," Yes good morning.\n"," Hello Maureen.\n"," Hi um my husband put manure down on the lawn oh about it's been down for a week . Wondering whether it's okay to mow or should you wait until the rain's finished.\n"," Oh well I think the rain's finished now and the rain will have taken all of that cow manure deep in to the roots so yes I would say it was fine to mow today.\n"," Fine to go . And could you quickly I need the garden sp the garlic spray that you use.\n"," Oh just a couple of cloves of garlic it's really easy Maureen a couple  of cloves of garlic all m mashed up buh with the back of a knife or something or um put some hot water in.\n"," Yeah I just know I guh I know what to do I just need the measurements .  you're in a hurry.\n"," Oh well the it's just ih there's no real measurements you can just dilute that with  um one to ten  ih with normal water and  spr off you go.\n"," And soak it for the night.\n"," Theh uh uh uh save it for the night darling absolutely.\n"," Thank you so much.\n"," My pleasure thanks  for ringing.\n"," Bye.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COMNE6-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Well the wait ended for year twelve students today as they found out through the mail or on the net just how they went. What a   a rugged time it is till you complete the exams 'n' you have the big let down 'n' go off to schoolies week and so forth then you think uh oh   the big day we've gotta wait for it well today it came. It's the start of a new life for most of those young people uh they go on to further education or enter the workforce or some of them just chill out for a while. For a select sc uh few a perfect score but for most of 'em uh are happy with a pretty healthy pass. So what does it all mean let's uh find out now from the Senior Secondary Assessment Board of S A uh Dr Janet Keightley that's a real mouthful Janet isn't it.\n"," Yes we usually refer to it as SSABSA  it's much easier .\n"," SSABSA sounds much easier.\n"," Yes it certainly is.\n"," Well uh your work's done how how  how do you feel now.\n"," Well our very intense work is coming to an end although at the moment the SSABSA staff are now on the um results enquiries line talking to students who want a better understanding of what their result package actually meant so we're still a little bit busy Christmas day will be uh the time when we'll be able to relax.\n"," Um the process has it gone uh as in past years pretty much uh to plan.\n"," Yes this year's process has been a very smooth one um great cooperation between our schooling sectors and the teachers in the schools terrific uh work by the markers who we train and then do all our mark marking and standard setting and of course the SSABSA staff are just magic their commitment to students is just exemplary and they'll put those extra yards in which is what we've had to do and in fact by doing that this year we've actually managed to make it twenty-six days between the last exam and today in the letterboxes.\n"," It still seems like an eternity though jan dan Janet doesn't it .\n"," Well from from a student point of view  it might but from our point of view when we realise that we have in fact l had three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand pieces of student work looked at in those twenty-six days and my database managers tell me that we've moved one-point-one-six-million pieces of information around to get these students' results out today  so when you look at those figures you think twenty-six days seems so short.\n"," Uhuh it's a mammoth exercise isn't it  uh do you ever y'know I mean you don't wanna highlight the mistakes and obviously y uh y'know you   in the main everything goes perfectly but uh are there ever you get a perplexed student ringing up saying hey that can't be right because I know I did well 'n' you've given me uh y'know terrible mar marks.\n"," Yes yes I mean the the issue for SSABSA is that we say that we are human and this is a human endeavour and as a result of that there's two kinds of uh benefit there's a benefit and a d a downside I guess the benefit is when you're sick on the day of the exam we know what to do and we have special provisions and special processes   uh ih the dih uh downside of it is that we also make mistakes but at the moment we believe that we have enough checks and balances in those twenty-six days that we hope that we catch nearly every one of those but occasionally one slips through and students are able to ring us and um apply for a clerical check if they want to make sure that we mah managed to count all of their work all that all their questions were marked that we added it up correctly and so the students can apply for that. Um very rarely do we find that we've we've fallen in a hole.\n"," Not too many mistakes  well five students didn't make any mistakes at all twenty out of twenty in five subjects across the state.\n"," Well five students made uh gained an outstanding achievement which was twenty out of twenty I wouldn't say they were didn't make any mistakes  I also wouldn't  nearly they were not  perfect but they have performed in an absolutely outstanding manner and I'm in quite in awe of their performance.\n"," What is uh this new uh recognition of community policy.\n"," Well we know that students now are living very complex lives we know that they are very much involved in the community and uh in a variety of ways either through structured programs that are developed by the community meh organisations and sometimes on a personal basis. We've also talked with students about this and we're really sure that there is very serious learning that's occurring in these kinds of activities whether it be a mem a Queen's Scout or a Duke of Edinburgh Award or whether it be with the Country Fire Service or um tt m music uh some of the music boards um there's a wide range of those formal community programs and so now over the last twelve month SSABSA has in fact given students status in their SACE for some of those programs the students can gain up to eight out of the twenty-two units and um we are very careful about ensuring that it is quite significant year twelve level learning that is occurring in those programs.\n"," It's very commendable trying to to fit that in amongst uh everything else they're doing.\n"," Yes exactly in fact we know that students are uh many of them are in the paid workforce they are very very committed to serving their communities they take up volunteering roles they s coach junior sports teams they have significant family carer roles I mean your previous caller was talking about nutrition I mean there's a number of our students we now know are the sih the sole carer for another person in their household which includes making sure that they get a balanced diet and they have to understand what it means to eat the five food groups  and so we now ask them to gather that information together to demonstrate to us that they've learnt significant amounts and for that we'll give them a SACE unit towards their twenty-two. So and I must say that this is um uh very very cutting edge internationally for um year twelve equivalent assessments and um we are have found through an international study that this is a very successful way of opening up students' life chances 'n' also encouraging them to continue to learn.\n"," Janet uh there seems to be an increasing trend to split year twelve into two years uh what are your feelings about that.\n"," Well it's building on the comments that I've just made about our research into students' lives sometimes I feel tired when I listen to some of them tell  me what they're juggling and they're trying to balance a study and serious work at year twelve they're as I said they're coaching sports or swimming they're um looking after a group of disabled children one day a week uh in their swimming pool or um giving them lessons they're caring family they're looking after elderly parents grandparents or those kinds of things so there's just not enough hours in the day if they were going to do all of those so wuh I find that um being able to accumulate your SACE units over a number of years actually allows them to maintain the standard of a quality SACE and also carry out some of these other responsibilities.\n"," Janet uh Garry from Novar Gardens wants to know how these people got twenty out of twenty for all five subjects if they made mistakes.\n"," Ah well twenty out of twenty means that that's absolutely outstanding achievement it doesn't mean that they're absolutely perfect I have to say. They um to get twenty you have to demonstrate outstanding achievement your raw score might be one-ninety-nine out of two-hundred but that is still regarded as an absolutely outstanding achievement so there's a small range at the top there that would give you twenty out of twenty um.\n"," Has there ever been a perfect score.\n"," Oh we do get students who get two-hundred out of two-hundred for their examination yes  certainly which means that absolutely every question they answer to the standard that we accepted expected. And I said that.\n"," Now that's frightening.\n"," And as I say I'm very much in awe of these students I think they have done a stunning job.\n"," Janet um well done um  you're coming to the end of of uh a a tough year obviously and it looks like it's all going according to plan and uh there are sixteen-thousand students who can be thankful to you for getting the results out uh ahead of time.\n"," Yes thank you very much.\n"," Lovely to speak with you.\n"," Lovely too.\n"," Jan Keightley. From uh SSABSA I won't go right through the title of the name because it'll be uh two o'clock before we even get there but um on the subject of uh students who have done incredibly well. James Krumrey-Quinn scored ninety-eight-point-five he studies at uh Rostrevor or studied at Rostrevor and he joins us on the line now James congratulations.\n"," Thank you very much Graeme thank you very much it was actch if I can correct you there sorry it's ninety-eight-point-nine-five.\n"," Oh that's uh.\n"," But that's doh not to worry there.\n"," Buh uh no well I'd  I'd be quibbling too ninety-eight-point-nine-five.\n"," So just that little bit away from ninety-nine  which is a bit disappointing because  y'know it's the magic number.\n"," Now wuh how would it be like for a a a a dumb student like myself 'n'  a lot of the others y'know you get to this time of year  and y'know you get your results and all you wanna know is if you if you've passed or not now you knew you knew full well that you were gunna pass um w were you expecting to get the results you got.\n"," Tt I guess um it comes uh the the work ethic really is muh is was my indication so basically putting in the time and the effort uh er. The amount of time that I put in uh with that I knew that I was gunna get y'know a a a mark that was um quite desirable and obviously I um putting in uh the uh assignments that we did throughout the year uh were another indication but in addition to that last year I actually did two year twelve subjects as well which is what Janet was.\n"," Oh no you split the year yeah.\n"," Janet was speaking about before. And um uh doing those two subjects gave me a good indication as to what the uh year twelve standard was across the state albeit for last year. And s.\n"," Right so you did four what were the four subjects this year.\n"," This year uh modern history maths or mathematical studies physics and Italian. And last year I did uh studies of religion and uh German.\n"," So what are you hoping to do uh once you complete your studies.\n"," Uh at the end of uh law c a law commerce degree at Adelaide University hopefully crossing my fingers.\n"," I think you'd  be pretty safe.\n"," I'd like to think so  but um I'd like to be perhaps uh work in the diplomatic uh field or perhaps uh uh I'd like to travel overseas or or work overseas 'n' 'n' live overseas perhaps uh in the U N or or in the E U uh those sorts of things because I'm I've got a strong uh social justice uh background.\n"," Ah yes I see you were head of the social justice committee uh prefect of the school.\n"," Th that's it .\n"," Um d d any other activities did you find time for anything else.\n"," Uh I'm I'm actually w at work at the moment so uh I work at uh Booze Brothers the Norwood there and so I did that throughout the year uh in addition to that I was in the senior band at Rostrevor College ah uh ac in fact we toured to uh Darwin this year and a couple of years ago to Queensland  so um y'know amongst the study and also at the beginning of the year I actually went to uh university under the uh Headstart Headstart Scholarship Program and studied German there for the first semester so it's been busy but certainly doing the four subjects was uh doing only four subjects if you can put it that way was uh a a great help.\n"," I was uh talking oh only half an hour or so ago to a a year eleven student who uh who has got the daunting prospect of  uh doing year twelve next year what sort of advice would you give to uh a student uh approaching year twelve.\n"," Basically just approach it the same as you would uh year eleven because in essence it's just a step up from uh what you knew er all the workload to be in uh year eleven year ten uh and it's just it's it's gradually a step up and um ih er in fact um tt the only thing that really changes is I suppose the emphasis on exams and the emphasis on these uh major assignments uh which er in fact can be completed throughout the course of the year. And so basically just doh don't stress 'cos you will find the time 'n' in the end it is only year twelve if I can put it that way . Because it does finish and uh like this morning I just I couldn't believe that finally um mm the time to g opening er my results actually actually came it's just uh an incredible feeling that I I never thought would would happen.\n"," James congratulations uh  well done and we'll look forward to your progress in the future I'm sure we'll hear of you . James Krumrey-Quinn ninety-eight-point-nine-five um scored a perfect twenty out of twenty well done.\n","\n","\n"," Very good afternoon to you hope we find you well on this uh Wednesday   the day that the students of South Australia found out how they went sixteen-thousand uh students in fact uh completed year twelve exams today they found out we spoke to one young gentleman who obviously has his uh future mapped out in front of him. Let's find another one of our very intelligent young members of the community Nick Smith g'day Nick how are you.\n"," G'day Graeme good thanks how about yourself.\n"," Fine twenty outta twenty five subjects you must be feeling pretty happy.\n"," Yeah no very excited yeah it's good uh it's a good feeling.\n"," What subjects did you uh do.\n"," Uh I did maths studies biology chemistry physics and English communications.\n"," Did you do them all this year.\n"," Yeah I did.\n"," Certainly had your work cut out.\n"," Yeah no it was uh it was good fun.\n"," What school uh Nick.\n"," Uh St Peter's College.\n"," St Peter's College so you  highly recommend the school then .\n"," Um definitely yeah some great teachers down there.\n"," What other things did y I mean in a school like that you're usually sort of committed to sport 'n' and other other activities what sort of other range of things did you do.\n"," Yeah um I sort of balanced my year with a bit of sp with uh with some sport um football 'n' cricket. Um and also some music as well um which was good y'know duh y'know d offered me some time away from study um and that helped to relieve some stress so that was good yeah.\n"," The subjects you chose to do are they leading you in a particular direction.\n"," Um hopefully medicine in the future um and I think yeah I'm y'know aiming for Adelaide but I've applied everywhere yeah.\n"," I suppose that's what you have to do these days mind you you should be able  to pick and choose with uh twenty out of twenty.\n"," Yeah no I was yeah I was uh it's very helpful certainly yeah.\n"," What did you find uh the most important factor in completing year twelve to to keep you on track.\n"," Um I suppose having sort of a realistic view uh about how much study I could do 'n' y'know how long my study sessions were 'n' y'know if I ih I only did about six hours at a time at most um so y'know to have a realistic uh y'know a look at the bigger picture sort of uh helped me through it all.\n"," How did you cope with the stress.\n"," Um oh I think I coped y'know alright I had my sport and music 'n' y'know that sort of helped to relieve some stress 'n' that was good. Um and family and friends y'know they're y you I was supported by some great people so yeah ih I I didn't find uh stress was a big problem no.\n"," I think it's uh pretty important to keep balanced I mean uh year  twelve is important and your results are important but  life does go on doesn't it uh did you  have any time for social life.\n"," Yeah no I did um so I yeah sort of fitted that um around my studies as well and that was good y'know that sort of uh helped me to get away as well.\n"," Are you gunna uh get straight into uni or take some time off.\n"," Um I wanna get straight into uni. Yeah I sort of um feel as if I wanna take this y'know the next step right now um so yeah hopefully if I if I get into medicine I can do that.\n"," How about work have you fitted any work in amongst all that.\n"," Um no I haven't been able to get a job actually. Um I'm gunna try 'n' get a job  orderly at a hospital soon yeah.\n"," Um 'n' what form of uh medicine interests you.\n"," Oh y'know I'm not that sure at the moment um I think surgery but uh y'know I'm just gunna make that decision when I come to it.\n"," Well Nick congratulations to you that's a fantastic performance.\n"," Thanks Graeme.\n"," And it's uh obviously been born out of a lot of hard work  and a  and not a an inconsiderable amount of grey matter. Congratulations  to you.\n"," Thanks so much Graeme.\n"," Nick Smith. Twenty out of twenty in five subjects ah dear oh dear some of us can but dream   eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh if you'd like to give us a call and uh someone who's done just that is Grant from Gilles Plains g'day Grant.\n"," G'day Graeme how are you.\n"," Fine thanks.\n"," All the best for you 'n' the sease for the festive season to you 'n' your family 'n' I hope uh two-thousand-'n'-six is a better one for you especially.\n"," Thank you I'm sure it will be.\n"," Further I'd like to wish all the uh year twelve students all the best 'n' hopefully that they got what they wanted in reference to results because um uh we had the um   trauma uh bleak pleasure of it last year with our daughter . And all I can say is anybody that's into year twelve next year in two-thousand-and-six to the parents just let 'em go if they wanna stay ims in their bedrooms lock themselves in the bedroom just supply 'em with food 'n' drinks 'n' so forth  if they're willing to study and do it.\n"," Yeah m actually my two boys have gone through it my my second uh lad completed year twelve last year had a different attitude to it and treated year twelve like any other year and he got through but um it wasn't traumatic but you're right there it's it's really up to them isn't it what by the time they get to that age they're they're b gunna make their own decisions make their own way.\n"," Tt oh yes yes yes. Graene  mone  of the wain  reasons I wanted to rih or the main reason I wanted to ring you today was um unfortunately it's hit the front page of today's paper and on it's also on page five is the Graham Johncock situation in the courts.\n"," Right.\n"," In actual fact if you look there you'll find that the uh Advertiser's running a debate do you consider j Graham Johncock's penalty to be too lenient. Three weeks suspension 'n' a thousand-dollar fine plus the fact two-thousand-one-hundred dollars to the police 'n' the victims. I actually think it's absolutely disgusting that he got three weeks suspension. For the fact that um um these are my views not the views of the radio station Five double A because of the situation with Bob Francis which is going through at the moment   what's the judicial system cuh coming into when you get somebody that's been suspended for three weeks 'n' a thousand-dollar fine.\n"," What uh I I have no idea of what the standard fines are do you have any idea of what the  the average sorta fine is.\n"," Uh I've got no idea what the standard fine is um look don't get me wrong I follow the Crows with the wife 'n' so forth 'n' things like that but when you see a photograph of John Reid uh Geof Motley uh following I think in reference to all this football should stay with the club it should stay behind closed doors in reference to um anything to do with the sport 'n' anything to do with this with um .\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COMNE7-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Been to the city lately tried to find a park maybe you've gone into one of the council's own car parks 'n' footed the fees there or perhaps it is that you've parked out on the street and found that indeed there are new parking restrictions that apply uh and that with the time you require to do your shopping you're probably gunna cop a fine. It is having an impact those in the know believe and we're joined now by Stirling Griff from the Retail Traders Association welcome along Stirling.\n"," Yes good afternoon Nicole.\n"," Nice to talk to you for the first time this year and no doubt uh first of many during the year.\n"," Look I'm sure that's likely to be the case though one thing I do need to mention though Nicole is that the R T A itself hasn't existed in this market for about twelve months. Most of uh the council we're still continuing to meet on a regular basis but uh not officially as the Retail Traders Association.\n"," Okay so you still uh is ih it's under a banner but not under that official banner  essentially.\n"," Absolutely there was a lot of politics going on between New South Wales and Victoria and all of us decided frankly that we didn't want to be associated with it so uh. Anyway we're still involved in uh key issues with the city and also uh retailing generally in South Australia.\n"," Well and it's good to have a voice for those issues because we understand how important they are talking  about issues   is it your belief that parking is one of the reasons that some people decide perhaps not to make as many trips into the city centre as they otherwise might.\n"," Look absolutely and it's it's been that way for  many years and shoppers choose a destination due to its accessibility and the merchandise offering so if it's difficult to find a park or parking costs are high they will definitely shop elsewhere and the last thing any retailer wants is to lose business. Now the interesting thing is that it's not always got to do with the cost of parking a lot of it the majority of it really is accessibility and that's signage 'n' people knowing where the best parks are 'n' so forth.\n"," Well and we've also had significant change as well and and what happens then is that it throws people out if there's a place that they used to park and walk perhaps it might have been a small distance into the city where they're no longer able to park for the same time frame um people decide sometimes it just gets too hard.\n"," Well you are right 'n' and the interesting thing with that is that we're all territorial when it comes to parking  and I'm sure that if you think of of where you park  uh you're bound to go to uh  uh a particular um car park and you always want to get your park on that same level  'n' if you can't get it you get very frustrated so . It's quite uh quite funny how we all work that way.\n"," One of the suggestions uh I noted from comments in the paper today from the chief executive of Harris Scarfe Robert Atkins is that perhaps if the council is going to be reaping such rewards through parking fines they might look to reinvest that uh to reduce the costs of long-term parking which is what then attracts shoppers to the city area is there some  merit in that.\n"," Yeah look there definitely is uh ih ih there was a couple of points that are that are worth making on this the main issue is the lack of short-term free parking uh y'know you go to any major regional shopping centre and there isn't a problem 'n' and many people who receive fines are not long-term parking offenders they are shoppers or or business people who have for one reason or another been held up a little and have been nabbed with a fine. Now at the the very least there should be more leeway with time for these people perhaps an extra ten to fifteen minutes over the expiry time but the big issue and and the important um uh way to move this whole thing forward is that many of us have have felt for many years is for the council to encourage people in the city by making all of their car parks free for the first hour and then increasing the cost progressively in subsequent hours.\n"," Well you've got my vote . Love the sound of that.\n"," Yeah I mean that would make a huge difference to the city and uh it would benefit everybody including the council for revenue I would imagine.\n"," Uh and I uh it is interesting because I think you're right where it's something quick that you want to get in buy get out or something that you need to do it could be simply a paying of a bill whatever it might be y'know putting some money onto a lay-by um  you're you're less inclined to do that where you've gotta pay peak for for zooming in and zooming out.\n"," Yes yes definitely I mean uh and every year the city's retail share of business declines now a big contributor to this is accessibility like parking it's also followed relatively closely by limited food and grocery offerings because people don't come to the city for their weekly shop. They tend to v visit more for general items 'n' the likes but improving parking accessibility is number one on the list followed next by the cost of parking in the city.\n"," So Stirling with a great suggestion like that where are you going to take it I mean what's  the likelihood of of getting uh the various councillors to nod in approval.\n"," Look it's something that uh many of the key retailers around town in fact uh the associations have all lobbied for it's well and truly time for us to get back into this issue again and really it's quite simple just make the first hour free at council cark parks and the second point would be to look at ways to improve accessibility like having signage that updates frequently with locations 'n' the number of parks available like you get in many markets interstate and those two factors alone would uh make a huge difference to uh market share of the city.\n"," Well we'll perhaps try 'n' do our part by uh tackling the lord mayor on that issue and see  where he stands I thank you for your time Stirling.\n"," Good on you. Bye-bye.\n"," Stirling Griff. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh I'm late for my news headlines I better go there and then I'll come back with your calls is it parking that causes you to perhaps shop elsewhere do you find it a pain in the butt when you're looking to come into the city simply to do something that you wanna do quickly zoom in zoom out do you find that it's just too hard so you simply don't bother uh and of course there have been some changes to parking in recent times as well that have put in additional restrictions areas like I'm sorta thinking along Frome Road way where you were able to park for a longer period of time so you could park there wander in y'know not pay car parking fees 'n' I know they're not significant in comparison to interstate but some people don't wanna have to pay them and I understand that y'know budgets are tight. Uh they put in restrictions and I find now driving into work that a lotta those spaces are simply left empty it seems great waste to me.\n","\n","\n"," Okay let's get straight back into your calls on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh Nicole Haack with you through until four o'clock this afternoon indeed each and every weekday afternoon and lovely to have your company with me for my first day back today I hope you'll stay with me right throughout the year 'n' I hope you'll uh phone through as well we certainly encourage those telephone calls good afternoon Paul.\n"," Yeah hi Nicole welcome back.\n"," Thank you kindly.\n"," Um just about uh car park in the city I actually live in the city  um and yet I won't go shopping at Coles the Central Market or Central Market simply because there's no car parking around I will drive to Unley to do my shopping or Kurralta Park.\n"," Is that right so you ih you actually drive away from your home environment.\n"," Yeah exactly um   and the other bad thing about Coles in Central Market is you're not allowed take the uh trolley up to the car park . So y'know you can't do a major week weekly or fortnightly shop because you can't carry it all s even physically up to the car park. Um so I don't go there for that reason but also if I do park there I've gotta pay extra to park there. Um the other thing.\n"," It's still one of the cheapest in town though isn't it. I mean that's it's I must say  it actually draws me there for that reason because I find that it is and I apr I appreciate that whole notion of actually having to carry the lugg the ih y'know  your groceries.\n"," That's just a major thing though I mean uh h how do you physically carry y'know weekly or s or fortnightly shop with you when you go major shopping.\n"," Can you not  go through 'n' use your trolley 'n' go up or up  the uh lift.\n"," No.\n"," Okay.\n"," Yeah which is which is ludicrous. Um well ih unless it's changed in the past few months but I know you couldn't do no 'n' I haven't been na back there because I actually go away from it. The other thing I find really frustrating and friends do as well are a lot of reasons they don't come out they will go to like cinemas or nightclubs in the suburbs is you look around the city and there are so many loading zones and  parking stickers at all times so you get a loading zone y'know for ten minutes at all times and I'm thinking I've yet to see a truck  load or unload at two A M on a Sunday morning . And yet they're not you're not allowed to park there and I do know people who have been pinged with parking infringements at two in the morning on a Sunday  so th they have inspectors out to do that  and you're thinking if you want people to come in at night 'n' try 'n' make the city vibrant 'n' that why not free up these zones make them Monday to Saturday nine to five or whatever. You certainly don't need it on a Sunday morning or y'know at two-o'clock in the morning to stop people parking there.\n"," Yeah uh what you're talking about there is just allowing common sense to prevail  y'know rather than the heavy hand that comes down and says oh what if we leave it like that we'll probably cop y'know I I hate to say it but I suspect what we're talking about here is a revenue stream .\n"," Well exactly I mean it was the front front page of paper today how much money they're making from fines 'n' that 'n' you're wondering how much money they're making from that sort of thing by pinging someone at two A M on a Sunday morning who's parked in a loading zone knowing y'know they're gunna get pinged for it but y'know  thinking well surely that's not now but it is and fifteen minutes at all times y'know . Free things up in the city a bit.\n"," Yeah if you 'cos if you do the sums Adelaide City Council supposedly made an extra million dollars this year in fines uh and they employed eight new parking officers so if you looked at I 'n' I don't know what a parking officer might earn but l let's say I uh I'm pulling  a figure outta my head  but let let's say they earn forty grand a year  or something like that so you've employed eight of those do the sums as to what it's actually driven in terms of revenue.\n"," it's obviously they're egh they're they're expecting to make well above the cost of employing those eight people  which means they're gunna send 'em out at two A M in the morning to ping people who've parked in loading zones that says at all times.\n"," Well uh I tell you what happened for for um me the other day 'n' this is whilst I was on holidays actually we had uh we have a a a common driveway at our place and so it's shared with the neighbours but wuh we had friends parked in the driveway um and they pulled their car out so that a person who was parked in the in the driveway could get out and they parked it in the front residential area for say well look it would've been a matter of two three minutes uh and thankfully we encountered probably one of the nicest parking inspectors I have encountered ever actually who actually knocked on the door and yelled out 'n' said look just letting you know I I actually need to fine this car uh unless you're prepared like you're going to move it 'n' we were like oh it's just been moved out to allow another car to get out. Um common sense prevailed and of course the car was put back in but I mean  you're talking a matter of minutes and this was at about ten o'clock at night Paul.\n"," Yeah I had  that same sorta thing I parked on my driveway which is sorta like a f half the footpath just to unload some shopping so I was inside for like five minutes come out 'n' I've got a parking ticket.\n"," Yes . They're out there.\n"," And yet directly opposite me is um two-hour parking zones and I actually rang the council one day nuh last week because there was a car that'd been parked in wuh same spot in a two-hour zone for over a week and they'd never receive a ticket not a single one . So you think alright y'know I park for five minutes in my own street y'know  in my own house to unload somebody parks all day every day 'n' they don't get a p ticket.\n"," Wasn't your week for buying a  buying a lottery ticket that's for sure .\n"," Certainly not no.\n"," Pleasure talking with you Paul.\n"," Thank you  bye-bye.\n"," Hello Greg.\n"," Hi how are you.\n"," Very well thank you.\n"," That's good I was just ringing up to talk about my ambitions for this year.\n"," Absolutely.\n"," Yeah well the firh first and foremost is I need to get myself a job for thuh a thirty-eight hour job so I can start paying the bills that I'm behind in . And secondly I can I can start saving some money so I can marry my beautiful lady by the end of the year.\n"," Aren't you gorgeous.\n"," Yes 'cos we can't we we can't set a date 'cos we haven't got the money to do it so .\n"," Well I certainly wish wish you all the best in that regard.\n"," Thank you very much.\n"," How long you been looking for a job for Greg.\n"," Well I was I'm I was outta wur I was uh working up until Christmas time but I got   I got a lovely Christmas present  told me my services were no longer needed . So y'know the work wasn't there but that's fine.\n"," Isn't it harsh that it always seems to happen I mean I guess cuh companies reassess as the year winds down but it's just the it's it's the most tragic time to do it to anybody.\n"," Yeah and I've ah y'know since then I've put my name down at job agencies and I mean th they try 'n' help you out they get you a day's work here or there but it just does it's not enough to keep you going or even to save some money  so.\n"," What sort of work you looking for Greg.\n"," Well I've I have a forklift licence so  I can y'know operate any f any kind of forklift um and j just general labourer work if if necessary I could y'know I I'm pretty um open in that s y'know sense where I'll I'll try anything 'n' give it a go.\n"," Yeah you'll put in the hard yards 'n' do the hard physical work if you need to.\n"," Yeah and if I can't do it well so be it I've given it a try  y'know . Theh theh.\n"," Greg and that's all somebody can ask of you someone who's prepared to give it their best shot.\n"," Yeah that's right.\n"," Uh  look wuh with an attitude like that I'm sure it won't be too long before you're back out there and uh and uh giving it a good run. And  hopefully by the end of the year Greg you've you've got the ring on the finger.\n"," Yeah well I hope so.\n"," I do too I wish  I wish you all the best 'n' look if there's anyone listening in uh this afternoon who's looking for someone um who may be able to get out there 'n' and do the labouring work um we'll pass 'em on to you Greg.\n"," Well I hope so is there any way that yeah I could leave a number for you.\n"," Sure can I'll pop you on hold you can leave that with my lovely producer Monique.\n"," Alright thank you.\n"," Good on you. Uh good afternoon Peter.\n"," Good afternoon welcome to the new year.\n"," Thank you kindly and to you.\n"," Uh thank you. Just thought I'd I'd try 'n' pass some positive feedback regarding uh regional operations regional passengers into the new Adelaide airport.\n"," Sure please do.\n"," Um I had reason to be on a a Rex flight uh from Kingscote back in uh a couple of weeks ago on a hot day. And it was uh about thirty-three passengers onboard clearly the majority were from Norway uh Sweden. They were obviously on a on a a large trip . And uh we got back into Adelaide and not all of them were young and it's a fair hike through this maze from the tarmac uh once we got into the airport proper we're faced with this screening process because Kingscote Ceduna Port Lincoln don't have screening facilities . Now alright fine jobs to be done we accept that but the the attitude of uh 'n' this is where the feedback I hope to provide   the attitude of of Chubb Security was was almost c aggressive uh towards uh these overseas visitors and and certainly uh there was a gentleman in front of me who would've been in his sixties carrying uh a set of X-rays and no hand luggage he was clearly into Adelaide for a medical interview and they decided that he should have to take his riding boots off to have them put through the scanner.\n"," That that's actually r really commonplace nowadays I might say because um uh uh oh and I don't know what it is that's in shoes obviously y'know you understand where they're steel-capped but I've got various shoes where when I wear them  um they always go off 'n' and you see every time you go to the airport you see people taking their belts off 'n' their  shoes off  'n' and the like um and and they're not calibrated the same either because one pair of shoes that you'll go through one airport with will go off 'n' they won't in the next . I can't quite figure that out.\n"," The the the point being I I take your point but the point is he he wasn't young he clearly was in pain he was offered no chair  he was set up in front of uh of the rest of us particularly the overseas guests and there was an almost inaudible tangible no don't do this don't make him do this . The man was in pain uh they insisted that this be done. Uh we know that manufacturing is declining in this this country in the next four five years   we have to be smart about what we offer uh the world uh to attract people in uh and tourism clearly could be one of those those ventures for this state and this country and uh we we all pay a surcharge uh for security and we I think pay a surcharge to help fund what the interest payments for this new airport  and uh I I think uh we need to look at the distance that the not so young uh m m communih members of the community look at the distance they have to travel inside the airport as well as this very long walk uh from regional aircraft. Um a a number of these tourist centres are gunna be serviced in future years  uh at the far end of this this new airport 'n' uh if we are contributing a fare surcharge on every t uh every ticket that passes through Adelaide perhaps we can look at uh an extensh extension of that peramrilator that uh the the t travelator or whatever they call it.\n"," Sure and uh alh the alternative option as well is uh and I've seen this in operation in um several of the interstate airports is the little buggies that they  y'know transport people on um if you're you have an injury or you're in some way not in a position to be able to walk a distance um they'll take you from one spot to another on one of those.\n"," And hopefully they will look at that I mean we I don't need to s s uh I don't mean to to to bucket them uh it's a new enterprise uh as you said earlier this afternoon one will've thought they would've looked at best practice around the world. Uh hopefully they have 'n' theh 'n' are 'n' they are succeeding in a number of areas with that. But certainly the long distance for regional uh passengers elderly passengers and and uh I would encourage Chubb Security to uh look at some in-house training 'n'  'n' 'n' maintain the right attitude. A job has to be done ag.\n"," That that's  spot on actually Peter that's where I'd come back to it's about how you approach it isn't it no I  I must say also in line with that um just uh h just yesterday um and it wasn't wasn't Adelaide airport it was another airport but  um there was a uh a lady coming through and and she was confused as to why she was going off 'n' and uh instead of actually explaining that y'know she needed to remove this that 'n' the other it was it was an aggressive approach that was taken to her um it wasn't Chubb Security it was another security firm but um it it's all about I guess y'know maintaining the right demeanour and and keeping that balance between um oh uh I guess just making things easier for people as opposed to y'know understanding that there are going to be some some difficulties that you've gotta encounter due to security reasons but making it as easy as possible and balancing that up with  the security needs. Yeah Peter you enjoy the rest of your afternoon.\n"," Same to you thank you.\n"," Ta ta.\n"," Bye-bye.\n"," We're gunna take a break 'n' come back with more eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh when we come back actually some tips on what to look for investmentwise if you got some spare cash. Most of us don't but if you have got some spare cash what should you look at for two-thousand-and-six.\n","\n","\n"," Got any money and you're looking to invest it's always good at this time of the year to take stock so to speak have a look at where you're at financially have a look at uh how you might prepare for the future. And if you are an investor of course you wanna have a look at what the trends are 'n' what uh sectors might be hot for the year ahead that being two-thousand-and-six of course 'n' we're joined now by the director of Prescott Securities David Middleton welcome along Dave.\n"," Welcome well thank you very much Nicole.\n"," Uh I guess as always the markets change from year to year those things that are hot one year might not be the next and uh part of your job is to keep it uh abreast of all of that what can you share with us at this point in time.\n"," Well probably the it comes as no surprise to anybody that nothing's really cheap at the moment there's no  there's no fantastic bargains in property there aren't any fantastic bargains on the share market it's uh it's it's one of those uh one of those situations where um whilst nothing's like extremely horribly expensive either theh it's pretty hard to find bargains you've gotta be really looking towards buying investments that have got a m a m a reasonable prospect of doing well in the longer-term.\n"," Mm so so that's the key isn't it to n to not be looking for a a y'know a sh a short-term gain that may indeed have some pitfalls with it but to understand that maybe you should be looking what would we suggest five to ten years down the track.\n"," Well we quite like looking at things that way we think it's more m uh five to ten years is a bit more predictable than five to ten minutes really and and uh and things can be moving along in one direction but uh it may not and you might make money in the short-term by sort of just hopping on to the to the nearest tram but sooner or later it can it can uh reverse on you and then you run into problems so thinking about what's m the sorts of of investments that you might like to own that have got a a real future we think is the way to go about it especially when markets're as they are at the moment.\n"," So at this point in time are you able to pinpoint any particular industries.\n"," Well hmm h uh w it's it's more the it's more trends really uh I was listening to the uh chappie that you were talking to before about the airport and he was talking about manufacturing industry declining in Australia well that that really comes as no particular surprise because you've got this enormous competition from the providers of cheap labour in in China and other parts of the developing world. And the fact that a lot of our manufacturing is now being exported offshore is actually quite a good thing because we've got a a sh a shrinking workforce here in South Australia or about to have a shrinking workforce in South Australia and so we actually need to shift from manufacturing of goods 'n' st uh to other to other sorts of things. And so   try to avoid uh investing in companies that are subject to to competition from China and from India and those sorts of ah sorts of places is a good idea and looking for to invest in industries that are that that will benefit from increasing world trade and and moving goods around uh we think they're pretty good.\n"," So transport and logistics is one example perhaps.\n"," Well  yeah we think so and and another is r the f everybody knows that the population of Australia is aging but they immediately think that they need to invest in funeral directors. But the reality is that that uh ten years ago or even fifteen years ago sevent sevent being seventy was old now being seventy is kinda the prime of life. And and so we're we're living longer but also we're we're w with all the advances in technology where we can get replacement parts 'n'  and and pills to help us do everything from um enjoy an active sex life to to various other sorts of functionality means that we've got a a growing market amongst uh amongst retired people there'll be almost twice as many retired people in ten years time as there as there are now so sort of focussing on the on the sorts of things that that that s s uh mature im um consumers invest in um is is pretty sensible.\n"," T certainly makes sense doesn't it we we've got about uh thirty seconds to go but just ih one other area I note of interest is that of child care.\n"," Well there's the d the the rate of population uh or sorry the birth rate increase for the first time 'n' we've got governments uh giving tax atseh uh t incentives to use child care 'n' the need for people to stay in the workforce and all of those things seem to us to make child care an area which is which is a rapidly changing area that is worth watching and perhaps investing in.\n"," Well let's hope that it's a positive year ahead uh we'd like to perhaps catch up with you a little down the track thanks David.\n"," That'd be great Nicole thank you.\n"," Director of Prescott Securities David Middleton.\n","\n","\n"," Ow what a wonderful afternoon it is a gorgeous day here in Adelaide and wonderful to be back with you. Of course Nicole Haack with you through until four o'clock this afternoon still plenty of time for you to get involved today and we wanna have as many of your calls as we possibly can that's our aim for the year ahead to get you involved as much as we can through your emails your faxes and indeed most importantly your phone calls on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh. I've said it earlier I'll say it again too if you have some suggestions about what you might like us to discuss if it you've s been listening for a period of time 'n' you've been thinking gee I wish they'd talk about this or they've never raised that why not send us through an email and let us know or a fax we'd be happy to take up some of those subject suggestions for you and certainly give you credit in doing so uh we'll try and accomodate as many of those as we can throughout the year this year because we wanna get you directly involved because this is your program you drive it so let me know what it is that you'd like to hear us talking about eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh uh we've raised certainly a number of subjects with you this afternoon and still keen to get your perspective on some of those I wanna know whether you think a national I D card is a good idea or not uh are you one of those people who's somewhat fearful as to how that information may be used somewhere into the future as to how secure it might be concerns that indeed if we've got all of our information stored in the one place could I D fraud be easier. Uh would we in fact facilitate uh those who are looking to steal other's identities as opposed to work against such things as terrorism you may have a perspective on that one I'm I'm reasonably comfortable with it on the basis of saying that I would like more information you can never make up your mind until you know exactly how something such as that is going to work but I wanna in hear what you think eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh also interested as to whether parking is an issue for you coming into the city. Are you concerned that there is too many fines being handed out too many restrictions in place and that the ease of parking or indeed the opposite of that is what causes you to make a decision to stay in the suburbs if that's where you live. Uh and also today I'd like you to share with me what your desires 'n' dreams are for two-thousand-and-six it might've been a resolution that you made but is there something specific in particular that you'd like to achieve this year or like to see happen something special to you that indeed you wouldn't mind sharing with us. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh.\n","\n","\n"," Good afternoon Richard.\n"," Hello there uh   there the uh I D card uh where wih   er it's not needed really because uh if uh y   if you could have the uh if everybody   in Australia   or is it especially the new immigrih immigrants  could be uh tt uh natural naturalised uh you know uh   yeah naturalised or uh. Be an Aussie citizen.\n"," Ih it's it's about though being able to identify yourself at a particular point in time.\n"," Yeah well well if everybody could get uh   oh a citizen be a citizen where we it's automatically on your card.\n"," Got it accepting/excepting of  course Richard that we have we have people living in this country who may never become citizens of the country and may never be in a position  to be able to be.\n"," I'll I like to say this uh all these all these um uh terrorist suspects that were arrested   by the police  if they g suh if they cuh uh wanted want all these rights put put to them  well they should uh be a Aussie citizen then all the rights would be accepted . You know that.\n"," I think the thing is Richard and and this is of course we've seen examples of this happen that is that uh people will say whatever it takes and will be of huh oh a certain character or appear to be of a certain character in order to get Australian citizenship um only to find that they are actually working against everything that this country stands for later down the track and and then we get into that whole discussion of whether um the citizenships should be revoked 'n' whether they should be deported um I've expressed an opinion on that previously that's fairly clear and that is dh I I believe so the problem is where do you send them to. Um but I y'know I h I think that there's I guess some r related issues there but I think also regardless of whether you're a citizen or not you might be a citizen um it still doesn't necessarily mean that you're you're effectively able to identify through one card all of your f I guess personal details and that's what the I D card is supposed to do um and that's supposed to deliver I guess greater security some argue that it might do exactly the opposite though. Richard thank you for your call good afternoon Kevin.\n"," Hi Michelle  uh I'm the uh first-time caller but I've got some tips that might help some of your uh listeners. Um I've been retired from air conditioning and refrigeration for many many years but because people can't get fridge mechanics or air conditioning people  they're contacting me.\n"," Is that right.\n"," To come out of retirement  and I said to one person uh that uh said well my frost-free part's not working and I said well go to the down there and tell me is the fan working at the back . And   said no I said well you don't need a refrigeration mechanic you need electrician to replace that fan . That's all that's gotta be done but because that causes your frost-free . While that little fan's blowing that stops the frost from forming on the uh on your freezer.\n"," Well Kevin you've probably just saved that person and uh and many others a substantial amount of money beause if you called out the wrong person they'll still charge you a call out fee only to tell you that it's someone else you need.\n"," Yeah and another one contacted me they've got out their old   mother's um Bonaire and uh they said we're sitting in front of it 'n' they've put the water in and uh sitting in front of it they felt all wet and sticky and I said well um did you try the humidity control  there all that does in there there's clamps off the the uh water so that   it clamps off so the pump doesn't pump the water up over the top and down and then the the uh the blower fan blows across that and that's what gives you your cooling so I said go and tip your if the humidih humidity control's not working tip your water out down in the uh bathroom down in the bath and just use it as a fan . And another one um.\n"," Oh you're  a wealth of information this  afternoon Kevin.\n"," And another one is that people don't clean their filters on their air conditioners um you take the cover off and take the filter out 'n' shake it and uh and you can wash it if you like and then put it back in but if you don't  the air can't circulate through and that becomes a block of ice.\n"," Spot on actually I had that uh very problem in the last house in which I lived the air conditioning system was costing an absolute fortune and never seemed to be able to keep up with things but um h I indeed needed to point the finger at myself because I was responsible for not having cleaned the filter for a for a fair period of time. Fixed that one though Kevin um thank you for fixing other people's problems this afternoon as well.\n","\n","\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COMNE5-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Lawyer Bob on the job merry Christmas.\n"," Merry Christmas Leon.\n"," And if you have now this is your last opportunity before the program breaks up we are going to recess on the twenty-third but Nick Xenophon and Graeme Goodings will be joining us over the next three weeks to keep you company 'n' those issues that have been uh hot ticket items very much on the burner. But if you've got a legal question to which you'd like an answer in plain English pick on the expertise of Lawyer Bob a a very very good lawyer with over twenty-five years experience practising with seven others at Camatta Lempens in King Williams street. Hi Margaret good morning.\n"," Good morning Leon and good morning um Lawyer Bob I've listened to you but this is the first time I've really needed your help.\n"," Okay Margaret let's see if we can help you.\n"," Quick and easy uh  a friend of mine um   um father passed away. Left the house and a small amount of money to that person but there was a um a brother involved who hasn't seen his father for twelve years plus never done anything. He got left a small amount of money now he wants to contest the will. How are we gunna   what's our chances .\n"," Margaret your friend does need to get some uh legal advice  and see a lawyer.\n"," Have have got that  and and the lawyer is willing to go witness because the father didn't want to leave this son  anything  but he did leave him a small amount of money.\n"," Well you see w what what the the lawyer has to do is is to uh have a talk with you and have a look at uh the reason as you say why your father didn't give your brother as muh ih as much or that the brother of the uh of your friend as much money as uh as he has to the uh to the to your friend and they'll look at the conduct of the uh son  uh to see whether there's anything that's he's done over the years whether he's perhaps been given money by the parents before whether he's perhaps uh used the p the parents as a guarantor 'n' gone bankrupt 'n' they had to pay up money or whether he's been violent to them he'll they'll have a close look at his conduct uh and if there's found that there's been some conduct that's uh um disentitling they call it disentitling conduct well then that will affect whether or not he'll have a successful claim or not but look muh uh Margaret it is something where people do need to get legal advice on they do need to see a lawyer uh it's gunna be a matter in the Supreme Court it can be an expensive affair there will be a settlement conference though to try and sort it out before it goes to trial and hopefully they can sort it out there.\n"," Nineteen to twelve Lawyer Bob on Five double A good morning to Bill hi.\n"," Ah good morning Lawyer Bob.\n"," Yes Bill how  can I help you.\n"," I just want to I had an accident in September . Um where my car was written off now it's simply a fact that um I was up to stationary at traffic lights I  move when the green signal went abuh turned gr when the signal's turned green. But someone came through on a red and um and actually my car was a write-off.\n"," Right.\n"," Um now what is the position.\n"," Well ih it depends I suppose whether the other vehicle agrees with your version of what's occurred .\n"," Well uh the the uh female driver admitted um full responsibility to me and  to a police officer.\n"," Alright well Bill are you covered by insurance yourself.\n"," Yeah.\n"," You are look you should probably notify your insurers as well because uh what's gotta happen ih is whilst the other driver will be liable for the collision you may find they c might try to say that your you have some uh percentage of uh of liability in relation to what's occurred um so I would suggest if you're covered by insurance perhaps leave it to your insurers 'cos there's a fair bit of of money involved here. If you haven't got insurance though what you'd do then was you'd go 'n' get your car assessed or or work out what the write-off value of the vehicle is uh and what the salvage value is and then send a uh a letter to the driver of the other vehicle saying they're liable for the uh collision and that uh you want them to pay the amount uh d within twenty-one days.\n"," Okay Lawyer Bob here giving you legal advice on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh now I've res referred quite a lot of people to you in the last couple of weeks.\n"," You have Leon yep.\n"," Uh just a couple of the cases you've looked at.\n"," Yeah look a a c a couple of matters actually very similar uh where um uh people have uh split up uh they've been married for many years or been living together for many years and decided to uh to part and uh they parted amicably I mean there's no uh great uh arguments going on and they've agreed on on what uh the property settlement's going to be. Now there are difficulties in in not getting legal advice in relation to your property settlement. I advise people that that look you might be uh friends you might have uh separated amicably but you really should get a proper deed drawn up by luh by a lawyer.\n"," Explain why.\n"," Well the reason is this Leon because if you don't do it the your your ex-partner can always come back next year ten years twenty years time and make a claim against the property against your property 'n' you may have accumulated a lot more assets by that time and their argument may be well look when we did that settlement back in uh in two-thousand-and-five you never told me about your superannuation or you uh w yih I didn't get proper legal advice as to what was happening you were overbearing towards me all those sorts of arguments can be used but if you get proper legal advice 'n' have a proper deed done under the family law act uh well that can then be used as a bar   towards a claim in the future by the by the partner because each of the parties that has to go 'n' get some legal advice uh to make sure they understand what the deed is about.\n"," So you even if it was amicable or more than so you wouldn't go to the lawyer together you'd go to separate lawyers.\n"," Yeah you would need to go to separate lawyers look I I know it sounds as though it's a expensive process to go through but the the way the law is structured in this is is the law wants to make sure that you both have independent representation that you both uh are able to to look clearly at what the other side's got and g and be sit alone and g and get that advice from a lawyer independently to say well look your your husband's got a superannuation uh of about five-hundred-thousand dollars you're entitled to X percentage of that uh you've got children so you've you've gotta look after those kids  uh all those things have to be taken to account so you do need to get some independent advice in relation to it.\n"," Okay uh Selena wants to know \n"," Right uh what criteria well look uh uh a number of criteria. The first thing you've gotta remember is that you've gotta be uh honest with your insurers when you renew your policy or when you first sign up for the policy. If you don't tell your insurers that you've been disqualified previously or that you've been done a few times for speeding uh then it's possible for the insurance company to void the claim later on uh and that does happen from time to time   if you've been convicted of a duh a dishonesty offence you should let your insurance company know because they might decide that they're not gunna insure you any further. So so ih people have to be very careful when they enter into insurances   it's no use paying out six-hundred dollars a year for car insurance if it's only going to be voided because you haven't told the uh your broker or your insurance company the full facts uh of uh of uh what it's about. The other way that a insurance company may uh try to uh to get out of an accident is if you don't co-operate with them in relation to their investigations. You'll find soon after an accident's occurred you'll probably get a phonecall from a private investigator who uh wants to have a chat to you about what's occurred now if you don't co-operate with them   tt uh that th you'll find the terms of your policy say that that that they can then void the policy again so bear bear in mind that you should uh consider co-operating now   there is difficulty with that because if you've committed a serious offence like if you've been uh uh in trouble for let's say uh causing injury by dangerous driving uh well then whatever statements you do give to that investigator can also be used against you perhaps later on if you go to trial so I advise anyone that's charged with a serious uh offence uh with uh driving that causes a accident 'n' there's perhaps people injured they again they should go 'n' see a lawyer to get some uh some urgent advice in relation to it.\n"," Lawyer Bob on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh now a couple of other cases I want you to mention too that you've taken calls about.\n"," Yeah luh Leon uh uh Michael was uh was leaving a car park uh and he'd juh just finished using his mobile phone still had it in his uh in his hand as he uh uh turned onto the main road and uh hadn't uh done anything with it 'n' the police then uh stopped him and accused him of using his mobile phone whilst driving on the main road and uh and Michael says well look hang on I uh I wasn't using it I still had it in my hand now the inference is by the police officer of course ih is that well if you still in your hand um you're using it and therefore they've issued a fine against him now he wanted to know what he could do now if he's challenging what the police say 'cos he says well look I hadn't wasn't using it anymore by the time I was on that road well then he's gotta decide to elect to be prosecuted don't pay the fine elect to be prosecuted and then you go to court and then you have to tell the magistrate um that uh that uh you weren't using the mobile phone at that time and then it's up to the magistrate then to make a decision but the trouble he's gunna have of course is is to is to explain well why didn't you put the mobile phone down after you'd uh stopped using it.\n"," Yeah see Paul Fren makes the point uh from the police that touching the phone whilst you're driving is the problem. So you're gunna need to have a hands-free now remember with a hands-free you can talk on it but if you dial a number with a hands-free you're still touching the phone. So you could only I I suspect in practice   if you're in traffic or driving and you have a hands-free   you'd only answer the phone and be able to talk legally not to get prosecuted 'cos as soon as you touch the phone you're in that problem aren't you Lawyer Bob.\n"," That that's right that's right  uh Leon it's look it ih it is a uh uh a t a type of matter that that still  not much not many uh cases have revolved round 'em as yet I think most people are paying their fines uh so it's gunna be interesting to see uh whether people will take on the police in relation to these sorts of matters but just bis bear in mind that y'know even just checking your mobile phone to see what the time is   uh  is using  using your mobile phone.\n"," Hi John.\n"," Hi um Leon. Um I just wanted to aks  Lawyer Bob Lawyer Bob um can a bank open your account I've paid off my home loan my mortgage I've aksed  for   um to discharge my mortgage 'n' that to close the account I've paid all the fees 'n' everything that they've aksed  for. Then ten days later they've um the solicitors rang them to discharge my mortgages my house p deeds 'n' that  and ten days later the bank rings me back saying that they've re-opened the account and charged me a seven-hundred-'n'-eighty dollar fee for paying off the loan early.\n"," Alright uh.\n"," Are they allowed to do that.\n"," John ih what you need to do is have a look at the original contract that you've got for your loan  uh there will be a a document around somewhere  and and according to that document it may well say that there were penalties involved uh if you do pay off your loan early. What some people tend to do is they just leave a dollar in the um uh owing on the account 'n' just leave it there but I suppose that becomes difficult then if you ever want to uh uh refinance it with somebody else. But uh look have a close read of the contract uh you'll probably find in there there is some sort of formula for for of of a penalty for paying it off early. If you're still unhappy you can always go to the banking ombudsman uh and uh and uh have a talk to them about it.\n"," And there is a free number a freecall one-eight-hundred number if you want that John look Lawyer Bob can I thank you for coming in today and also for the tremendous amount of work you do off air to help people out you've been an absolute bonzer person and uh everybody wishes you merry Christmas and a happy new year  and we'll have you back in the new year.\n"," Okay look forward to it.\n"," Okay. Lawyer Bob from three-forty-five King Williams Street at Camatta Lempens   eight-four-one-oh-oh-two-double-one. Are you uh you're closed during the public holidays.\n"," Uh yes we are Leon.\n"," Obviously and what about say the three days Wednesday Thursday Friday up to New Year and then   you.\n"," Oh I I think we've got a skeleton staff on but uh .\n"," Skeleton  okay.\n"," Don't know who answers the phone though.\n"," Lawyer Bob on Five double A and coming up shortly we'll talk travel with Max Najar.\n","\n","\n"," It's eleven past twelve remember you can call us on any issue you like on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh. Uh shortly we'll be talking to Barry Urquhart from Marketing Focus about this thirty-six-hour constant shop till you drop. I'm just interested as to how many people actually do this. Amanda was saying this morning that there are quite a few people who do and if you're one of those people that shopped at two A M now of course uh I suppose if you go and buy petrol at two o'clock in the morning and you go into a servo in a sense you're shopping till you drop you're not just buying petrol you might buy a few other things but when you've got shops open that do almost all sorts of sales at three four and five in the morning are there people that uh will just love to shop because they work unusual hours. Let's ask Barry Urquhart Barry merry Christmas.\n"," And thank you very kindly to you and all your listeners Leon.\n"," Does this actually work as a ploy.\n"," Well I suppose you've gotta ask the question why are they doing it and I've come to conclude there's two reasons why you would extend the trading to twenty-four hours and that is one to increase sales and two to provide sur service and convenience to your customers. Let me address those two issues. In the intermediate to long-term and the sustainable sales it will not uh uh it will not be effective it will be a very gradual sort of situation that will be isolated but more importantly and this is the ins interesting thing that's come out of some recent research that we did uh in Brisbane and in Sydney   what people are wanting if they are wanting convenience is not necessarily to have access to the stores twenty-four hours of the day what would be far better is and here are the three things they would want most of all more staff members in other words not waiting at checkouts more cash desks or registers available. What they would like to do is to interact with better-trained better product knowledge base uh part-time and casual staff because that's what they're looking for rather than extended trading hours and above all else they want staff of stores not to be using the p car parks in the shopping centres what they would much rather them do is to park out of the complexes so that the consumers can go in there and get premium car parking bays that's what people want rather than twenty-four hours trading.\n"," Barry uh given that you found this out via er uh customer questions why aren't they doing this.\n"," Well they think that theh uh y'know it's an interesting proposition a lotta people talk about being customer-focussed and uh Sol Trujillo from Telstra recently sent out a little note to his shareholders and he made a very profound statement 'n' I thought my God someone's at last listening I have advocated at seminars and conferences that you don't need to be customer-focussed you need to be customer-driven. Let the customers make the decisions for you now you don't pass value judgements on that 'n' I think that's part of the problem. People are doing things that they've always done they need to sit back and talk to 'em. See convenience must be tied to relevance and it's an interesting proposition but people're saying hold on if I want convenience I can go onto the internet. I've just received some stuff from the British Shops and Stores Association the chief executive's name is John Dean and he said that actually uh the retail sales through the internet are increasing and I'll quote if I may a hundred-and-thirty times faster than traditional High street sales and yet they still only represent three-point-five per cent of total sales so if people wanted convenience and they have access twenty-four hours of the day on the internet they'll go onto the internet they don't want it twenty-four hours of the day they want to interact with people what's lacking and you and I have spoken about this many times before Leon what's lacking in customer service in Australia today is one word personal it means more staff.\n"," Okay let me ask you this uh we've seen a situation uh and this is uh on to the business of labelling where uh Southern Eggs tell us today that Coles buy uh virtually uh uh the the the lion's share of their product but it's labelled packaged in Melbourne for Coles. Now that doesn't tell the consumer where it's from don't the supermarkets understand that people wanna know where their food is coming from.\n"," Absolutely and it's an interesting point.\n"," Well why aren't they doing it.\n"," Well I uh see  well  uh where are the decisions being made for Coles uh at the moment it's being made in Melbourne therefore they promote Melbourne I'm sorry to say that but it's kind of a a Melbourne-centric organisation that is centralised what we need to be is to decentralise you only have to read newspapers we got some gruv uh vegetables recently in Western Australia which were impregnated with E coli now my goodness gracious me consumers are saying hold on I don't want that merchandise.\n"," Was that from China was it.\n"," Uh that was from  uh Asia that's  correct now what they're saying is hold on this is about life this is about quality of life this is about peace of mind and of course the one thing that the buying agent and that's typically the woman of the household wants to do she wants to be able to sit back and say Good on you Mum Tip Top's the One and that implies that she's made the right decision women want to make the right decision she wants to buy locally and it's peace of mind purchasing what gives greatest peace of mind is when you buy locally and you know the people who are producing it because it's all about making the right decision.\n"," So uh uh again uh if if customers vote with their feet and demand that there is proper labelling will they eventually get it I mean mind you the federal laws are going to change but they've gotta be policed by the state and as you well know compliance is not something with which state governments deal easily.\n"," Look duh Leon if you sit back and wait for legislation and regulation you follow the herd. What this is a very clarion clear call from Foodland the independent retailers and the small specialist retailers and the farmers' markets and food markets right throughout Adelaide and uh even up to Hahndorf and into the regional areas of Murray Bridge and the like of South Australia to take the metal between their teeth 'n' say hold on this is an opportunity let's exploit the opportunity of being parochial let's really go out there and be serious about being local this isn't about packaged in Melbourne or packaged in Sydney that's not the issue let's start to have it as a marketing tool we'll become famous for it we'll do it in ow our advertising we'll put it at point of purchase and we'll uh see now there's the point 'n' I think it's very key if you put it in your advertising and you put it on your shopfront then that in an aisle by itself will attract people into the store. Once you've got them into the store it's easy the packaging will convert them and reassure them but what I'm simply saying is the packaging should be the third of three or four stages to really utilising that attribute of localism to be your marketing tool and your point of difference.\n"," Barry thanks for joining us that's uh Barry Urquhart from Marketing Focus on thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A. Are you one of those people that goes shopping at one or two in the morning are you going to partake in this shop till you drop campaign which is happening just before Christmas. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh at thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A.\n","\n","\n"," Hi Ron.\n"," G'day Leon uh I work in retail for one of the big two chains and uh believe me it's the worst week of the year to work in retail but uh I wanna make an observation and then a comment. I remember you interviewing Roger Corbett three four years ago  and he pontificated about the creation I think f of five-thousand jobs uh if and when we sort of extended our hours do you remember that interview.\n"," Yes I do.\n"," Yeah okay. Now the success of the trading hours now that we have at the moment forget Christmas aside that   uh that we're open till nine o'clock Monday to Friday um now I work in a uh one where there's only the supermarket 'n' a few specialty shops  there's no accompanying sort of K-mart or Target or Myer where you can get a bit of   extra  I'll guarantee Leon between Monday to Friday there is no-one in the store after six o'clock seven o'clock  and as a result   of uh the store I work for or the company I work for where they're just cutting back cutting back cutting back on labour all it takes is it'll be about eight o'clock at night all it takes is a couple of people with two full trolleys and then another dozen or so people coming in with just bits 'n' pieces y'know where they've and you've only got two checkouts going  'n' and you've got a couple of big  full trolleys  and then you get the you can see the the the customers' expression on their faces going oh y'know now grrr y'know sort of uh getting  uh annoyed with it  but we don't put 'em on y'know wuh we'll put 'em on on Friday uh or   extra staff will be put on on Friday specially in say the deli section and the meat  department 'cos the that's the and on Saturday in particular but believe me these extended trading hours Leon I have not seen   people still do the major shop on the Saturday and even the Sunday's not really that big.\n"," Ah Sunday I I've found even before Christmas Sunday  trading has seems to be quite popular  from from what I mean I've uh I've rarely been if you go to for example the shopping centres  and uh you do it on a Sunday  generally speaking there's a lotta people there . Lot of people.\n"," Yeah you you get 'em you get 'em at the start of the when it opens at eleven and in the last hour  but throughout the week Leon there's no-one there between six and nine o'clock  trust me and they only just shove on two checkout operators and as I said all it takes is  a couple of people a couple of bih  and you're gunna have people waiting.\n"," The the the the the shopping hours regulations as I understand them  don't mean though that you have to open it says that you can if you want to . So if  if the big  supermarkets are not getting the customers why not shut.\n"," Oh but you but you'll see that uh   uh when you're part of a big organisation that they're all open till nine there's none of thih the only thing is uh our shopping centre because it's small  uh our I'll say I'll say who I work for it's Coles  we won't be going for the fifty-two hours uh in a row  business 'n' we'll be we'll be just shutting at uh  at nine o'clock at night  'cos it's not we're not part of a a  y'know a weh a Westfield yes.\n"," W why don't the why don't the bigger supermarkets the ones with the big market shares go hell for leather in making sure that they label properly local foods so that people know what they're buying. W why don't they do that.\n"," I I mean I'm not in management uh Leon I'm just uh like um y'know a  a retail assistant yeah uh.\n"," Okay but but you you'd get some of the feedback from the public on that wouldn't you.\n"," Oh I gotta say Leon I ih it's more uh I don't g I don't get a lot of those sort of queries they'll say d'you know where this is made and I'll I'll have a look over the package for 'em 'n' if I 'n' if I don't 'cos I don't work in the fruit and veg  but I'm talking about like your packaged goods  I'll I'll have a look for 'em . But generally I I gotta say that's not really I very rarely had uh queries about uh origin but I I've had more where people come in   and because you're a major supermarket they expect you to stock   or they assume that you stock absolutely everything that's ever been invented or created and people come in with some obscure  uh food additives 'n' and you sort of say to them oh 'n' I'm I'm pretty knowledgeable of what we got in store and I'm saying  look I'm sorry I'm pretty certain we haven't got that that's a that's more a uh  a a .\n"," And and what about  what about the trend towards the bigger supermarkets for increasing uh in a large percentage their own home brand where they exclude a lot of the other popular brands that people used to buy.\n"," Oh yeah you you you definitely you definitely see that and um a lot of the stuff is just the brand name but in plain packaging  um and ih ih the the dead giveaway is where the packaging is very very similar and the colour scheme of the label  is very very similar you're  basically buying the sa th the same product uh whether Kellogg's or Sanitarium or  or whatever it might be  I mean some some of it is uh clearly offshore  and it's g deliberately the label is very very similar uh to sort of n not to con not to confuse but just sort of uh.\n"," Of course not .\n"," To to gr no to grab your attention. But uh yeah um yeah as I said yeah there's hardly anyone in after six  uh you get I I perhaps department stores uh it may be uh worthwhile I figure most people will get their fresh food shopping done by Saturday morning.\n"," So tell me uh are  the sooh are the supermarkets gunna be part of this shop till you drop thirty-six-hour thing surely not.\n"," Uh noh not ours no  not ours but you'll find uh I.\n"," I j I just can't see well I mean you can go you can already go into uh a a servo at some ungodly hour and some of them  have got quite a good range of stuff you pay a bit more for it but you're paying  more for the extra   for the extra  ability for the place to be open.\n"," Wuh well put it this way Leon I know that the Target near ours occasionally  they have these midnight sales where it's dark  and my wife has gone just for the but she finds that a lot of people that are there it's more a social thing let's go out let's see what's happening  there seems to be a lot of people milling around  but no-one's actually really buying anything . Y'know yeah it's almost like  it's almost like in the old days before people had television.\n"," We'll make it look  like we're shopping when we're not .\n"," They they'd look through a shop window  and watch the ih it's almost like yeah it's pah they get the kids in the pyjamas it's all a bit of a laugh let's have a look around but no-one actually buys anything .\n","\n","-----\n","Content of NAT3-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Good morning how are you.\n"," Ih is it true you've won the uh Australian Children's Book of the Year four times.\n"," Um I got four gold medals .\n"," Well that's good enough for me.\n"," They might be fooling me .\n"," I'd also like to welcome Kerry White she's the author of a massive third volume   just released of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography it's a an amazing tome. She's also a compiler of a website   that is the holy grail of Australian children's literature The Source good morning Kerry.\n"," Good morning Julie.\n"," Uh before we get into talking about these books and and Marcus's marvellous comments   w why do you make such a huge bibliography I could barely carry it into the studio. What's the purpose of a book like this.\n"," Ah I I guess it's best described as the equivalent of a map a literary map so it's for scholars and researchers and everyone who can sort of find their way through the field so   as well as this huge one you're looking at now there's two of similar size that   map the field from seventeen-seventy-four and of course you're possibly thinking there were no Europeans in Australia in seventeen-seventy-four but   nor children's books   but uh Marcie my colleague who did volume one includes books that uh that thought about um adventurers to this great south land. And then we go right through to the end of two-thousand well I carry it through to the end of two-thousand in volumes two and three.\n"," And is it true that you've you read every Australian children's book that's published every year.\n"," Yes. But that's not for the bibliography I just look at the books and describe them and and look at the artwork and so forth. But for The Source and for the two subject guides I publish back in the nineteen-nineties yes I do.\n"," An and The Source is now on the web   essentially what's that.\n"," Um it's a wonderful resource mainly for schools and libraries um for children and adults to use where they can go in and find out about books both Australian and overseas   and we're particularly dedicated to poetry. And so um for example if you had a v had a very harassed school librarian nine o'clock in the morning   and a teacher runs in I need some poems on angels for example . It does happen I can assure you. She'll just leap onto The Source type in angels in the poetry section and get a great list of poems some of them in full text if they're outta copyright that's just one example of the many things you can do on The Source.\n"," Well Kerry I think your credentials are now firmly established  as a as a a gee whiz expert on children's literature in Australia   uh I'd love to get your reflections to kick off our discussion   on how things have changed and perhaps you could start with some of the school readers of the nineteen-sixties and then we could   leap forward to uh some of the more contemporary works uh tell us about the nineteen-sixties . Is it your childhood.\n"," Yes because that's a really only one I can speak with  with any real information. I was at a large primary school in Wollongong called Keiraville public school.\n"," This is south of Sydney.\n"," Yes about eighty kilometres south of Sydney. Um it was at a time when a lotta people were moving into Wollongong so kindergarten I remember was packed out. We didn't have a school library we had the mobile bus from the city council library come around and I can't remember if that was fortnightly or monthly and each class would just file on and pick out their books I remember   getting the brumby books and um various others but you had very little time they just wanted you on and off tsh tsh tshoo \n"," So th so there was no library actually in  your school.\n"," No library at all. And we'd have class sets of readers and I've brought along just a couple of what would have been in the school and you said before that you actually recognise one of them.\n"," Y yes can you describe one just to  to remind people what we're talking about.\n"," Well this one called My Storybook Number Two it has a very plain green cover with just black and white drawings on it and it was produced by the Department of Education of New South Wales and the text is very simple it's um.\n"," Just uh just read the first page.\n"," Yeah I'll just read this one it's a little story called Pal. \n"," Pal being a dog.\n"," Pal being a dog indeed . Was Pal dog food back in the sixties  I can't remember.\n"," I don't know this could be the origin of the name.\n"," It could. \n"," Now now we can probably break the reading 'cos I think we've got the drift I mean.\n"," Have you got that  it's not too complex.\n"," Well what does that book tell us about the world of those children.\n"," Well this wuh I think would have been given to children uh around five or six maybe more like six actually because I don't really remember being given readers in kindergarten for example. Um so it was very structured. Um obviously written with the intention of teaching. And that was its simple intention   we'd look at them now with a certain amount of nostalgia which makes them more attractive to us like this one actually has the original uh a picture of the original model of the Holden. So that um sort of interests us.\n"," It has a  nostalgia but as a as a a a a person who thinks so much about Australian children's literature now how would you assess that   if someone took that into today's classroom.\n"," Well it would teach people to read in the end but it's not very inspiring  and uh when you think of the lack of other literature we had to draw on as well   um one thing that we had that was very very nih important was New South Wales School Magazine   which is still going and in that you had extracts of novels both by contemporary Australian writers you had poetry and original material a lot of   uh current writers had their start in School Magazine like Robin Klein and Anna Feinburg um.\n"," So an important source of uh quality reading.\n"," Yes.\n"," And and are there equivalents of these sorts of simplistic readers from the sixties   and the enriching uh department publication magazine in all states and territories in Australia is this a common Australian thing.\n"," I think so I know there was a similar Victorian magazine. Um that people still talk about from those days and and is now going in a different format. Um and I'm not really fully aware of any other states but these sort of readers were everywhere. Um I have another one called the Whitcombe's Story Books which were everywhere  in Australia and New Zealand. Um and yes they they just speak of a completely different attitude to teaching reading .\n"," And and in essence what is that attitude.\n"," Well it was just the basics. And um  I don't know if you remember learning to read I don't. It just sorta happened.\n"," Well I remember things  called the S R A Reading Laboratories  they were all these sort well well f for the modern listener what are they  'cos they were I remember them in the corner and I used them a lot.\n"," Yes I did too. Um they were just a box and it came from the U S and there were uh reading cards and you moved through levels you started at level one and went through all colours I think there were colours and and numbers.\n"," Yes it was definitely colour coded.\n"," And you would just sorta start at a level and I know in my class we were very competitive and we'd all try and race through the lot because you'd read a little passage and then you'd do comprehension questions do you remember that.\n"," Uh uh very vividly what I'm getting from you is ih if we're talking about the sixties 'cos what I'm interested in is the change to now  and and what it tells us about our approach to children and childhood. In the sixties it was very learning orientated around literacy  rather than firing the human imagination.\n"," That's right I think the idea of fired human imaginations was left up to family and friends that like that was a personal thing uh and so the the school wasn't providing um fiction as such and so at h you depended on what happened at home. Um I know in Wollongong we did have a a reasonably good children's library but that had only started in the forties like it hadn't been around a long time and I and it became better resourced by the sixties it was quite good but not everyone had access to that I presume.\n"," Well well let's leap forward then  to that young Marcus the ten year old we heard  at at the front of the show.\n"," What a marvellous reaction.\n"," Well clearly able to critically assess a wide range of books to understand the sort of action he wants  even the sort of covers and topics he wants  what does that tell us about the modern child and the I suppose the resources that they have.\n"," Yes well he just was so sophisticated in his reaction to he knew exactly what he wanted and he I I was really very impressed yes.\n"," He he sounded like an informed consumer  now.\n"," That that's a very good description.\n"," Well well it implies to me he's got more choices it's not the  the van pulling up at the school that doesn't have a library that you run into grab a book and run out  he's choosing  from a menu.\n"," That's   indeed that's that is the big difference with with the past and the present like now there is a profusion of books. It is um so much easier for children to access books and uh as well as the library specialist libraries everywhere. Schools I don't think a school exists now that doesn't have a school library it's just unheard of. Um and the the books are bought did you realise oh uh that last Christmas the sales of children's books went up twenty-seven percent so.\n"," Well if we're speaking book sales that's an ideal opportunity to bring in my next guest Gary Crew because he sells very well   and if you've just joined us we're on Life Matters on A B C Radio National Julie McCrossin's my name and my guests are Kerry White   the author of a massive bibliography of Australian's Australian children's books and we're discussing Australian children's books and how they've changed over the years and what that tells us   about childhood and our approach to reading. And also joining me now from Queensland is Gary Crew now Gary   is a very successful writer give us your assessment Gary of the current uh choices for children when it comes to books do you wanna focus on a particular age group like uh perhaps young teens.\n"," Um  yes uh Julie I think that in many ways that choice is um diminishing. And we could argue this diminishes because   if we take the analogy of um T V with um y'know real life T V what do you call it um reality T V. So one show's popular so we'll put on three shows so we'll put on seven shows so by the time you start watching T V at night you've got y'know the whole program is taken up with   hideous forms of reality T V interpretation. What happens therefore is often in the trade um a very successful genre of book um can grow and grow and grow like Topsy um.\n"," Can you give me an example of what  you mean.\n"," I can. Um you might get y kind of your books with bum in the title. So okay and there are quite  a few of those around I don't care about that that's cool I like kids who say bum actually . Um but what happens is while the originators of this uh concept m are are very might be very good at it. Lesser lights uh join in uh on that uh bandwagon and you end up getting pretty y'know crummy books as  a result.\n"," Are you saying that we're somehow in our   marketing efforts uh reducing the sort of intellectual and imaginative content of books for young uh young teenagers.\n"," Uh I think that's very possible. Yeah I do where I mean ask any teacher these days. Uh I think they'd say that they're fairly uh familiar with the expression of dumbing down   um of materials given to children. Can I just go back to one thing Kerry said which fascinated me um I'm sort of geriatric I'm fifty-seven   I went to school I started school in nineteen-fifty-three. In Queensland. Which some might think is a scary concept  but   we had the Queensland School Reader and ironically quite different from what Kerry faced in Wollongong in the sixties   the Queensland School Reader was squarely based upon great literature principally from Victorian times.\n"," Uh I think Kerry was actually saying the New South Wales Department of Education school magazine was also a great source of good literature.\n"," Well that's true. And do you know while it must've been dreadful for the teachers to have to uh excite a ten year old with that material   I mean y'know we we had things like um   Horatio Defends the Bridge uh we had excerpts from The Cloister and the Hearth for goodness sake. Um.\n"," And can you remember your own reactions as a young boy Gary.\n"," Well I I think I'm a freak um.\n"," Oh but no we we  love freaks here  on Radio National .\n"," Well I'm an author and I I lecture at a university. So I was hardly typical I don't think. It was the meaning of life and what Kerry did   say and I utterly agree with was that in those readers like S R A which I taught for twenty years which I did come across later were so impoverished in imaginative realms. The reader we were given was not it was just a glorious richness of literature. And I truly believe this is a great thing that I carry with me through my y'know intellectual and creative life   that younger people uh obviously working in a university in creative writing I'm teaching people as young as eighteen. They don't have. They haven't got that lovely wellspring of riches that was given to me through my primary school.\n"," And Gary is that partly because we now target uh in our publishing industry the market of the different ages of children   whereas in my childhood uh I can say tell you in my early teens as a wide reader I was heading off to George Orwell and Graham Greene and Jane Eyre and all the rest of it.\n"," Indubitably. Look you said at the beginning we'd like to talk about Australian stuff. At the age of fifty-seven I as I am now when I was little I had a couple of options let me explain some stuff. The Magic Pudding I thought was most excruciatingly boring thing I ever saw in my life. I actually saw it on stage and I thought it was boring right. So well that I'll handle that one quickly   but the point I'm making is this I had two options of things I could read basically Enid Blyton who's not Australian I know   but my preference was the Australian Ion Idriess. Now Idriess was a journalist come writer. Who specialised in stuff about the Torres Strait and headhunters and um y'know that sort of thing. His books were on the bed beside y'know my parents' bedside table and because there was such a dearth of books for children. Um I just moved to Idriess. And again I don't think it hurt me.\n"," Mm on Life Matters this morning we're discussing children's literature especially Australian children's literature   and my guests uh successful writer Gary Crew   and Kerry White author of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography a massive tome and a she's a gee whizz expert on children's literature   I'm keen to come to your calls our talkback number one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven   love to hear of books that lit up your life as a child or your assessment of of books now for children and I might go to Lynn in Ballina in New South Wales good morning Lynne.\n"," Good morning Julie.\n"," Thanks for waiting on what.\n"," Not at all.\n"," What would you like to say.\n"," I would like to say Gary at uh fifty-seven being geriatric is a laugh I am eighty . And I have no grandchildren uh so I know very little about current uh uh children's books. But there were two books in my childhood that truly influenced my life. Now don't laugh. One was Pollyanna. None of you uh may have read it it was about a little girl a daughter of a clergyman who died and all her clothes came from the poor box. But she could put a positive slew on whatever happened to her.\n"," I couldn't live a day without Pollyanna  I just wanna let you know that Lynn.\n"," Thank you thank you thank you Mrs Tittlemouse it was lovely and she taught me the power of positive thinking. The other one was What Katie Did  and for the information of your listeners.\n"," Cultural cream.\n"," I . A little girl who disobeyed her father swung on the swing in the barn and broke her back and was bedridden for X months. She was surly and sullen and uh uh put off all the visits her brothers and sisters made to her until one day an aunt came along   and said we have to change your attitude and ah she prettied up her hair and   and prettied up her room and uh put a smile on her face and Katie became the core of the family. Uh with visitors and flowers and so on. That was change your attitude and people will change their attitude to you.\n"," Lynne thank you so much for ringing a and I and we'll cane Gary Crew for suggesting fifty-seven is old if you're eighty . Thanks mate thank you.\n"," Okay .\n"," We'll travel to Melbourne now because Sam has rung in with a with a spirited defence of Biggles accused by a ten year old earlier on Life Matters   this morning of not having sufficient action Sam your view. Good morning.\n"," Well good morning Julie when I was five years old I thought Biggles had plenty of action. I thought I thought Biggles was fantastic and I was extremely miffed when this wonderful wonderful full set of all the Biggles stories was given to my brother who had absolutely no interest in reading   and theeh these books were deemed unsuitable reading for me .\n"," Now I'm a girl who stole her big brother's train set Sam so we're on the same wavelength here but what was it about Biggles have you become a member of the airforce at the Australian Airforce after reading Biggles.\n"," Uh no not not exactly um I I think I I I grew out of Biggles reasonably quickly but I think listening to some of the uh discussion this morning   it's just struck me and this is as quite recently now that I'm an auntie   watching sort of my uh nieces and uh nephews now starting to sort of grow up and getting to primary school   just how much when you are small the adults around you influence one way or the other   the books that are available to you. And that's whether they have books in the household whether they will allow you access to those books in the household or whether it's by introducing you to libraries.\n"," Mm Sam thank you. Thank you very much for ringing in I might just come to my guest Kerry White   on that question because you you feel that these days   in a way we m over control and over influence children's reading. Can you speak to that.\n"," Oh absolutely. Every book that was mentioned then I read as a child and here I was saying on the one hand there were no books to be got from school but I'd somehow got my hands on all of those titles and hundreds of more. I never went out of the house without a book. And I used to drive my family mad my I remember my grandmother and I'd be urging her to read the latest Enid Blyton mystery the mysterious whatever it was with the monkey and the little boy and so forth. Um.\n"," And did you sort of range like a chook on whatever you could find.\n"," Everything  I read whatever I could get my hands on   and I guess I did miss having a mentor you know someone who like um with Marcus earlier his mother led him onto Deltora Quest which he turned out to adore. Um I just went as like a chook pecking everywhere everyone's house I went into I would search their bookshelves. So I would go from reading um Enid Blyton to reading Evelyn Waugh  it was a very mixed diet.\n"," Now contrast that with today I was at a home last night having dinner with a mother of four girls   who when I said this was on the radio this morning insisted I bring in   Sandy Beach by Bob Graham Greetings from Sandy Beach and Magic Beach and My Farm from Alison Lester these are   illustrated young children's books . Uh mad that I these must be discussed and it was very clear that she was reasonably directive an in what her children had access to.\n"," Um adults are now very um uh knowledgeable about children's books. Um there's more professional interest in the area. There's always been professional interest in teaching children to read but now ih it's in all areas of children's books. I think it is over controlled like you said before I think there's children need to be given a certain amount of freedom in all areas of their life and in their imaginative life most of all . Um but it is wonderful that people are passionate about them and looking at those books that you just mentioned you can see why. They're just beautiful and uh everybody enjoys them mm.\n"," One-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven is our talkback number this is Life Matters on Radio National Julie McCrossin with you   and we're discussing children's books let's take a few more calls   and then we might hear uh some readings from some more contemporary Australian children's literature   but Hazel has rung in from Melbourne good morning.\n"," Good morning Julie I thought you might be interested in a slightly different angle   um from the point of view of an author because I think one of the things that uh readers do now is   they send fan email   but not just to the author because most authors have websites they actually send it to the characters. And I think that's an indication in the electronic age that uh uh books do cross the barriers um   um a as the author of The Hippopotamus On The Roof Eating Cake \n"," Just tell us about the title of that book again the hippopotamus one.\n"," There's a Hippopotamus On My Roof Eating Cake \n"," C can I just ask you Hazel before I let you go you you're the author of the book about the  hippopotamus. Do you answer the the letters  to the  hippopotamus.\n"," Yes I think all and I'm sure Gary Crew would agree with that all children's authors see it as a responsibility to answer I just find it a bit challenging changing um   changing genders and characters so often but um yes  it is a challenge.\n"," Thank you very much for ringing in. Uh Gary I might just come to you again Gary Crew a a children's author in Queensland   I was reading last night your book The Inner Circle and I thought I might just talk to you a little bit about it because we can   bring in uh fiction for slightly older readers. This is uh well tell us the in in a nutshell what the story's about.\n"," Well for a start it's twenty years old. So it's like me talking about wearing flares  so it's a bit scary. Uh it's about two boys one uh indigenous boy and one uh white city boy   who meet uh they're both essentially uh homeless or from dysfunctional families uh and establish a friendship. Um they become as we would call homeless today or they squat   uh in an old power house where they set up kind of life for each other and eventually um they realise that their loveless lives um have no fruition or no no no future at all.\n"," And and t would you agree that it reflects that uh more contemporary trend albeit that it's a little old now   of trying to address for the young reader   the some of the tougher issues in life.\n"," I think so y'know the remarkable thing um. Hodder publish that book now   and I have said to them don't you think it's past its use by date. And they the publishers constantly say no no no it's still selling. Um which is somewhat embarrassing but y'know somebody must like it somewhere. But it still addresses issues that are unresolved. Uh in youth. That issue of alienation for example.\n"," A and a very frank exploration of the breakdown of a marriage and the impact on a young  man.\n"," That's right and it happens y'know it happens all the time.\n"," Could I contrast that Gary I've got a a book in my hand you may not have seen yet I think it's about to come out   Maxx Rumble Crunched and it's all A F L   uh footy stories  there's there's not a lot of words in it there's a huge  uh illustrations o of footy . A and it's it's clearly designed for the reluctant boy reader . I wonder what you think of these books.\n"," I think there is a very real place and I'll tell you why. What you just said um about the illustration is hugely important   to particularly to young males. I don't want to really gender this conversation but there is absolutely any teacher will know any librarian would know   that young males are attracted to visual. So if we want to turn young males on to reading part of that attraction is to give them one of two things. Either a high visual content or a high intriguing non fiction content. E G psychic phenomenon um y'know dirt bikes rally bikes football. And I think that part of luring children into reading um means that they will remain there.\n"," Mm what I'd like to do if I may is uh come to our callers in a moment we've got a b a b a board filling up one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven   of people wanting to talk about Australian books that excite them. Let's hear just a a a moment of readings from some very contemporary   Australian books and we're going to s uh hear a little bit from Paul Jennings also from Ruth Starke's Nips Eleven and Phillip Gwynne's Deadly Unna starting with Paul Jennings.\n","\n","\n"," A reading there from Phillip uh Gwynne's Deadly Unna and before that Nips Eleven by Ruth Starke and a and a moment from Paul Jennings his Unreal series   and on Life Matters this morning on Radio National we're talking about Australian Children's literature   my guests are Gary Crew very successful writer from Queensland   and Kerry White compiler of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography volume three uh a series of massive tomes that cover all Australian children's books. And let's go to some of our callers Goldie from Ringwood has been holding on good morning.\n"," Hi.\n"," Hello what would you like to talk about.\n"," Oh look I w um particularly as a teenager was a bookaholic and um I had a unhappy childhood and I just um disappeared and talking about books that take you other places I was very much into   things like John Marsden Tomorrow When the War Began which is hugely popular. Um a.\n"," What's it about.\n"," It's what it is is it's about a group of teenagers and they're sort of ah fifteen sixteen I think   and they're starting to be uh aware sexually and having relationships and they go away on a camping trip   and while they're away this war happens   and their entire town and all of the world as th far as they're concerned has been annihilated and um and th and or people have been taken away and imprisoned   and so they h set up this reconnaissance team and they are stealing tanks and   they're making bombs with stuff from their parents' farms and it's just amazing. Um and I lah I loved them also um Robin Klein and Gillian Rubinstein fantasy   um going somewhere else is important to me.\n"," Yes tell me more about the the fantasy and why you found it so attractive.\n"," Um it was that sense of um being in another place disappearing into a world that felt different that made me   feel like I wasn't where I was um and maybe sometimes that's a little unhealthy I think   um I guess in a sense I wasn't in touch with reality very much it wasn't a pleasant reality I wasn't popular at school my homelife was unpleasant. But also just that magic of that what if this could happen what if there I could be a hero like in Tomorrow When the War Began what if I could go to another world or find an alien and who's wants to learn from me another language and   all this stuff it was just   in intriguing I think.\n"," A and Goldie how old are you now.\n"," I'm twenty-five.\n"," A and what are you reading now.\n"," Um well I'm actually doing English lit at uni this year so I've just finished reading Jane Eyre an accompanying novel Wide Sargasso Sea and I've loved them. Um find them fascinating I must say I read um the Pollyanna books as well . And I read Anne of Green Gables I'm s  was addicted to them.\n"," I'm just so pleased Anne of Green Gables has cracked a mention  'cos she changed my life.\n"," Oh me too. She sh I I for me that was almost fantasy as well 'cos it was so different to the world that I lived in.\n"," Yes.\n"," Uh I've I've got a all the little accompanying books 'n' used to cook up her recipes and .\n"," Goldie thank you so much I think if if if anyone's captured the joy of reading it's you this morning  thank you very much . Thank you. Uh Liz from Coburg good morning.\n"," Good morning she sure has. I also remembered I read the Green Gables   Anne of Green Gables but the book I was calling about was The Family Conspiracy by Joan Phipson.\n"," A and what's that all about and why of all the books have you rung in about that.\n"," Well the I was my my mother bought me this book I think it was the first book   that I ever owned myself and it actually won the Australian Children's Book Council Book of the Year in nineteen-sixty-two. And it's um about a a f a a family a country family who   um need money and all the children um go on their little projects to raise money for their mother's operation. And um I think I suppose I love the book because it um   it it's about making do and resilience and and um children doing things.\n"," And Liz do you have children.\n"," I do I have four children.\n"," And so how do you approach this question of of their reading we were discussing earlier do you direct it and try and shape it or do you let 'em uh rove about.\n"," Well they do what they like now 'cos they're very they're they're twenty-five to thirty-two. Um but I read.\n"," I I think they're probably old enough to choose.\n"," I think they might be. But they I read to them like hours and hours. Uh I read to them all through their their childhood and they're all   um book lovers . All of them book lovers even my son who had a great difficulty learning to read   he loved books even though he couldn't read them.\n"," Uh because you read them to him.\n"," Yeah yeah  and he'd get his brother to help him read his younger brother to help him read and he loved books he'd ha passes books on to me now and says read that mum.\n"," Liz thank you very much  for ringing thank you. Uh.\n"," Thanks Julie bye.\n"," Thank you Katie's rung in from Sydney good morning.\n"," Morning.\n"," You've got very prolific readers for children as well.\n"," Yes and I was um yeah my older daughter is a an amazing reader and actually started to worry in about year two at school that she would read every book in the school library   which she basically did. Um I mean she didn't actually read them all but she read every book that she was interested in and end up hah having to go onto adult books quite young. But one of the things that   I really I learned when when she was little   was from my mother in law who just who was interested in teaching children reading   was just to expose not to be directional not to direct them into what to read although but 'cos I always loved the Alison Lester books and used to read that to the children   but she would go to some store and buy what a whole rae h all the Dr Seuss books or all the Dick Bruna books on y'know knock down prices   and just send them to to the kids   and they just there was just always this wealth of rih of reading material. One time she bought these horrible books that you could press a button on the side and a nursery rhyme would start to play with a really tinny sound and I just   thought oh I I didn't want them them to have them. But they love they just they m just read everything  and anything.\n"," Katie thank you so much ring I'm afraid we'll have to go because you appear to be speaking to us through a tunnel   uh but I'll take one more call and uh then I'd love to uh uh ha uh have a listen to some of our classic Australian children's literature we have a little taste of that for you   but Sally from Sanctuary Point has rung in good morning.\n"," Oh good morning yes. Um like Kerry I was at Keiraville school one of my many schools in the sixties. I'm a former teacher and now tutoring and I just wanted to speak briefly although they're not Australian literature in in defence of the S R A kits.\n"," Now we should just remind listeners who may have joined us we were discussing earlier these uh   oh a reading kit system  that was in the primary school uh uh classrooms of the sixties and and some sharp things about their barrenness was said earlier what would you like to say.\n"," The difference is that they were informative they weren't neccessarily imaginative and I'm sure that a l vast amount of my nat current general knowledge   and interest in in very eclectic interests   came from reading those S R A kits where you skip   with no apparent reason from why dogs have spots to um y'know nuclear power with no political correctness whatsoever .\n"," I love that no apparent reason because I guess teachers these days are more obsessed with context aren't they.\n"," Oh we use it all the time and we try and integrate everything and it's we try and attach meaning to everything whereas each S R A card was a discrete unit   but I was fascinated nonetheless.\n"," Mm Sally thank you very much for ringing and I'll just go to Paul from Ballina in northern New South Wales good morning.\n"," Morning Julie great to talk to you.\n"," Yeah thank you.\n"," Uh just ringing probably I've got the typical male story I read my first book when I was twenty-one . Avoided all the books at high school and uh the first book was The Exorcist and I couldn't put it down   and I've been a an avid reader ever since.\n"," A and what sort of reading are you into now.\n"," Oh it's very eclectic um poetry   through to science um fiction and a lot of biographies.\n"," And Paul is it possible for you to   look back at your childhood and think wh why you were so resistant as a younger man.\n"," I don't really know uh maybe it was a cultural thing a macho kinda thing but I know that   when my son was young I read to him every night I thought maybe uh he he might be different I'd help him y'know be a reader and and really he's never taken up uh the interest in books.\n"," I suppose.\n"," He's now twenty-two.\n"," Righto uh well a question that interests me is what happened when you were twenty-one why suddenly pick up The Exorcist.\n"," I can't remember it's too long ago .\n"," Well thank you for ringing Paul because I have to say normally here on Life Matters when we have these discussions   our uh our uh callers are fifty-fifty men and women and it's been noticeably female dominated today.\n"," Yeah yeah I know it's often the case.\n"," Righto well thanks for ringing.\n"," Thanks Julie.\n"," Uh Gary Crew in Queensland uh I n you said earlier you didn't want to gender this discussion   and yet uh ih it has been a remarkably female call in hasn't it.\n"," That's right. Uh a d a serious issue Julie is this. Rightly wrongly indifferently we find reading and promoting reading for children is seen to be part of the stereotypical female's nurturing role. And that is a terrible terrible travesty. And we've seen this in the range of callers I was so delighted I've been sitting here actually waiting for a man to speak y'know . But that is the case.\n"," A and in your   readership are you  are you are you attracting boy and male readers to your range of books.\n"," It is my first and highest priority. If I have a priority other than creating imaginative worlds. My highest priority is to reach young males.\n"," A and is there any way your publisher can in any way indicate   who is reading your books is that a hard thing for an author to know.\n"," Not my publisher that's not their role but when I visit schools that sort of thing uh you you know. Uh and I do know as I said before while that lovely little boy who spoke earlier who's name I've forgotten.\n"," Uh Marcus.\n"," Marc marc Marcus   uh spoke about action I hear that connection. I also do know that that visual thing um is the big thing with boys.\n"," Wh what do you mean.\n"," The visual element of a book illustration or whatever. Any librarian will tell you you take a group of boys into a library they'll go straight for Tintin or Asterix because they're they're visual they're they're full of like comic pictures . And boys seem to like a higher qual a higher degree of visual   and a lower amount of print text.\n"," Let's go to Barry from Melbourne who's rung in I think on this exact topic good morning Barry.\n"," Good morning yeah exactly that when I started school   at the age of f uh five in nineteen-forty-seven   and the first primary school I went to was till nineteen-fifty-one and the boys all swapped comics and they were currency. They were they were currency you know if one comic would be   two for one if it was Superman against Captain Marvel or whatever. And um uh girls read books and boys read comics and uh it's exactly what you're speaking about we were all attracted to the visual and uh I can remember Tom Mix and Roy Rogers and all American comics   but uh that was what boys did in those days anyway.\n"," A and Barry can you remember the Classic Comics.\n"," Well for us Captain Marvel was  pretty classic.\n"," Oh I y th there was a series called Classic Comics.\n"," Yes I do remember those but they were a bit too high class for us. They were English I think. And uh we'd we read the American trash instead .\n"," A and are you a reader now.\n"," I've always been a reader yes yes.\n"," A and uh and would it be more books now.\n"," Oh always books yeah  I I went from uh that was primary school I suppose in one once I got into secondary school I started getting into   my favourite book as a kid was Treasure Island I read that about five times .\n"," I've still got a black spot in my hand right now.\n"," Good on you.\n"," Thanks mate for ringing in thank you very much.\n"," Thank you  bye.\n"," Uh Kerry White uh the uh author of this massive bibliography of Australian children's books   uh I'm interested in your response to that emphasis on   comics I mean in your bibliography would or or your work on The Source your website would comics or very illustrated books crack a mention.\n"," Oh yes definitely   there's even a a genre now called graphic novels where um much of the action of the book is depicted in drawings Terry Denton who illustrated Crunched that we referred to before is just   wonderful at that he's done a series of crazy crazy things that draw on myths and surfing and interplanetary voyages altogether in the one book  and there's a whole series and parts of the text that you can only read through like these strange comics that bleed off the page and then go into a bit of text and um. I'm just thinking I think Gary did a picture book that was set up like a comic is that right Gary.\n"," Yes Tagged.\n"," That's it.\n"," Steven Woolman yes.\n"," Uh tell us about that one Gary.\n"," Okay uh Tagged is based on a young boy who uh comes across a a shell-shocked Vietnum Vietnam uh vet in an old warehouse where he has hidden. Uh away from the world he is a y'know he's seriously ill this man. And the boy contacts him and the man tells him of the horrific experience of war. I just wanna get this in. What I wanted to do because the comic format or the uh graphic novel format so often celebrated war as the earlier caller said y'know in the fifties and sixties   I wanted to turn that genre back against itself to have a comic that celebrated pacifism . You see what I mean . Um I mean I'm a bit naughty 'cos obviously it still shows scenes of the horror of the war in Vietnam which is a bit seductive .\n"," Gary I'm interested y'know earlier in our conversation about Australian children's literature you   uh bewailed the uh loss of intellect and imaginative uh power  in some of the books that are targeted at the reluctant reader   and I'm wondering. I suppose is it possible to have these new forms of publication  that are high in visual graphics that muh sustain intellectual and an imaginative power.\n"," Absolutely.\n"," Can you think of any examples.\n"," Oh absolutely have a look at any illustrated book uh by Shaun Tan. Shaun is just Australia's illustrative genius and uh recognised throughout the world as such.\n"," A and aimed at what sort of age range.\n"," Ageless.\n"," Ageless.\n"," Which is the dream and I keep hearing Kerry say y'know spread this smorgasbord of books y'know. So when you get someone like Shaun and this is my dream too   I would like to think that my books were actually audienceless. And that you could cast them about the lounge or the house and the meandering wandering child could pick it up 'n' see gee that looks alright.\n"," Look we've got a a a boardfull of calls we're coming up to the ten o'clock news and I'll come to uh some calls in a moment but can I just say   I just read Possum Magic by Mem Fox illustrated by Julie Vivas   last night for the first time which is a shocking revelation. It's about to be uh reissued in a in a twenty-one year version of it and I must say I was totally engaged in an odd way it is ageless even though it's clearly aimed at children but let's go to Peta from Sydney good morning.\n"," Good morning um I I'm very been fascinated by the last bit of the discussion because I have three daughters and a son and I have despaired of my son ever reading anything but comics or the very very um frugal wuh books which are very frugal in words but he's just read Catcher in the Rye and loved it. Reached year eleven and finally read a book and loved it.\n"," What a great one to click with.\n"," Mm absolutely   um but really what I wanted to say was to compare my experience with my children's um I had the privilege of um being in Adelaide from   age six to ten and Adelaide was the best place in the ninety early nineteen-sixties. And uh I remember weekly visit to the Adelaide Children's Library. And we were four children at that time my mother used to borrow we I think it was four books maximum so we took home sixteen books every week   and returned them every week having read all sixteen. And it was the most wonderful magical place and when we'd read all the children's books suitable they bought more for us . And Adelaide library was the the start of uh really our whole family's reading   but um that was partly because you couldn't rely on the school library they had a handful of books and the public library was the place. What I found interesting with my children   was that the school libraries were so good by the time my kids went to school and they brought me books home that I'd never seen and I read with them um John Marsden and   and Robin Klein and uh so many of the authors that have been mentioned in fact what Goldie said was a repertoire of my girls read and it was just wonderful to read with them books they were finding at school and teachers who were providing them. And if I can just slip in we haven't mentioned Storm Boy um yet and I think that's a great Australian um in fact all the Colin Thiele.\n"," And I should say to people if you can't join us on on the telephone uh today 'cos we won't get to all our calls email us Life Matters at your dot A B C dot net dot A U or write to us care of A B C Radio National G P O box triple-nine-four   Sydney two-thousand-and-one your favourite children's book and why   I'd love to uh have a little reading of them   and also you can leave a brief message please be brief on this uh number oh-two-eight-triple-three-one-four-three-three oh-two-eight-triple-three-one-four-three-three let's go to Shirley from Elwood good morning.\n"," Good morning Julie. I'm I'm ringing about a book I have in front of me it's a nineteen-fifty-six edition   of The Way of the Whirlwind which was written by Mary and Elizabeth Durack and I can only assume that Mary was the writer and Elizabeth the painter   because the illustrations in this book are just so extraordinary and I remember as a child when I when I first read this book back in the early nineteen-forties   that uh the it was the illustrations as much I've been a reader all my life that was the story itself is also fantastic but   Elizabeth Durack of course did uh um gain a lot of um pos perhaps notoriety is the word but a lot of it media attention   because of her uh painting in the style of Aboriginal people um when she was much older but as a painter when she was young the illustrations are just extraordinary I'm looking at one at the moment   with two little Aboriginal children on the back of a crocodile and the uh illustration says \n"," Shirley uh thank you so much I'm gunna just try and squeeze in Michelle from Chilton in Victoria Michelle a very brief anecdote I'm afraid how do you get your children to read.\n"," Well ending on a funny note I've got a nine year old sports mad boy and trying to pin him down to a particular   style of book that would suit him I tried to get him to read The Famous Five which made a fairly big impression on me at that age. And um I have to laugh in the middle of the night   or later in the evening as he commenced reading the book he sung out to me mum mum what author in their right mind would call their kids Tom Dick and Fanny.\n","\n","-----\n","Content of COME6-plain.txt:\n","\n"," Where we are talking about how long it takes to install stuff.

The hardest thing.\n"," Yeah.\n"," Oh God it's just hie  finding the s right person  to be honest.\n"," Fresh meat.\n"," Can you just uh yeah can you can you just answer the following question.\n"," Sure.\n"," Mm.\n"," After you've spent time with a third party.\n"," Mm.\n"," What do you say.\n"," What do we say.\n"," Well at the end of it all what do you say.\n"," Well .\n"," Do you just say thank you and walk away.\n"," Well tonight we said thanks for the cuppa that tea and your ricotta pastizzi drink  but um.\n"," Yeah that  was about it but regularly  we just kinda talk about it.

I don't regret doing that on the radio for one second.\n","\n","\n"," We are talking uh about movies on the Paul Murray show here as we do each and every evening   at about this time talk to a whole bunch of people that have been driving back   from a film that they saw at nine-thirty or maybe were home 'cos they saw one at seven-thirty give us a call one-double-three-nine-six-nine if this applies to you on offer my friends for the best reviewer of the evening is a special D V D release   of a truly classic film. Glen saw the Butterfly Effect in Macquarie Centre mate what'd you think of it.\n"," That is the best movie I've seen in my life. Seriously I've seen a lotta movies and that that movie like yeah.  Blew my mind it's that good yeah.\n"," Massive call but why.\n"," Why.\n"," Mm.\n"," Oh it's just full of action and the twists and the turns in it 'n'  and the acting like Ashton Kutcher and the and the other girl that's in it that you haven't even heard of before . See she really plays her part well and I have to say that everyone should go and see it anyone who gives this this movie a bad review should be shot seriously it's a really good movie.\n"," I think you've just made a proh a poster my friend.  Now tell us okay now is it a thriller is it an action mooh what is it.\n"," It's everything.\n"," It's everything.\n"," It's everything it.\n"," Is it a porno.\n"," No .\n"," Is it a children's movie.\n"," It can be .\n"," Is it a cartoon.\n"," No it's a .\n"," Is it made by Pixar.  I think I've proven my point but yeah.\n"," Yeah yeah it's a bit of action I'll yep comedy it's got everything in it it really has.\n"," Well because my friend look. There may well be better reviews than you but because you did such a great job you're getting a copy of Gigli the worst movie of last year.\n"," Woo-hoo thank you .\n"," Ah good man. Alright give us a call one-double-three-nine-six-nine what'd you see at nine-thirty I may well have another copy if you're very good. One-double-three-nine-six-nine Nova nine-six-nine twelve-hundred techniques.\n","\n","\n"," And the Paul Murray show where we are fastly running out of time here I think I'll ih can invent words if I want to but we talk about the movies now just heard   from a young gentleman who declared none other than Glen who said that the Butterfly Effect was the best movie he's ever seen and there is no way that anyone who says that it is a bad film in fact he said that anyone who gives it a bad review should be shot. Lara is it time for me to cock the gun.\n"," No seriously it's crap.\n"," Why now don't give anything away but why.\n"," I mean I love Ashton Kutcher I think he's the biggest babe but  like seriously this movie was so below him.\n"," Oh well thank you so much I look y'know what 'cos I love you. You're not gonna got shot.\n"," Oh okay then.\n"," So you're you feel relaxed now.\n"," Oh definitely  I was hoping for the D V D but y'know  if it saves my life.\n"," Well I'm s see y'know what I mean  what a choice. Benjy you also saw Butterfly effect but at Fox what'd y'think.\n"," I thought that it was the craziest movie that I have ever seen in my life .

But if you've got a legal question to which you'd like an answer in plain English pick on the expertise of Lawyer Bob a a very very good lawyer with over twenty-five years experience practising with seven others at Camatta Lempens in King Williams street. Hi Margaret good morning.\\n Good morning Leon and good morning um Lawyer Bob I've listened to you but this is the first time I've really needed your help.\\n Okay Margaret let's see if we can help you.\\n Quick and easy uh  a friend of mine um   um father passed away. Left the house and a small amount of money to that person but there was a um a brother involved who hasn't seen his father for twelve years plus never done anything. He got left a small amount of money now he wants to contest the will. How are we gunna   what's our chances .\\n Margaret your friend does need to get some uh legal advice  and see a lawyer.\\n Have have got that  and and the lawyer is willing to go witness because the father didn't want to leave this son  anything  but he did leave him a small amount of money.\\n Well you see w what what the the lawyer has to do is is to uh have a talk with you and have a look at uh the reason as you say why your father didn't give your brother as muh ih as much or that the brother of the uh of your friend as much money as uh as he has to the uh to the to your friend and they'll look at the conduct of the uh son  uh to see whether there's anything that's he's done over the years whether he's perhaps been given money by the parents before whether he's perhaps uh used the p the parents as a guarantor 'n' gone bankrupt 'n' they had to pay up money or whether he's been violent to them he'll they'll have a close look at his conduct uh and if there's found that there's been some conduct that's uh um disentitling they call it disentitling conduct well then that will affect whether or not he'll have a successful claim or not but look muh uh Margaret it is something where people do need to get legal advice on they do need to see a lawyer uh it's gunna be a matter in the Supreme Court it can be an expensive affair there will be a settlement conference though to try and sort it out before it goes to trial and hopefully they can sort it out there.\\n Nineteen to twelve Lawyer Bob on Five double A good morning to Bill hi.\\n Ah good morning Lawyer Bob.\\n Yes Bill how  can I help you.\\n I just want to I had an accident in September . Um where my car was written off now it's simply a fact that um I was up to stationary at traffic lights I  move when the green signal went abuh turned gr when the signal's turned green. But someone came through on a red and um and actually my car was a write-off.\\n Right.\\n Um now what is the position.\\n Well ih it depends I suppose whether the other vehicle agrees with your version of what's occurred .\\n Well uh the the uh female driver admitted um full responsibility to me and  to a police officer.\\n Alright well Bill are you covered by insurance yourself.\\n Yeah.\\n You are look you should probably notify your insurers as well because uh what's gotta happen ih is whilst the other driver will be liable for the collision you may find they c might try to say that your you have some uh percentage of uh of liability in relation to what's occurred um so I would suggest if you're covered by insurance perhaps leave it to your insurers 'cos there's a fair bit of of money involved here. If you haven't got insurance though what you'd do then was you'd go 'n' get your car assessed or or work out what the write-off value of the vehicle is uh and what the salvage value is and then send a uh a letter to the driver of the other vehicle saying they're liable for the uh collision and that uh you want them to pay the amount uh d within twenty-one days.\\n Okay Lawyer Bob here giving you legal advice on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh now I've res referred quite a lot of people to you in the last couple of weeks.\\n You have Leon yep.\\n Uh just a couple of the cases you've looked at.\\n Yeah look a a c a couple of matters actually very similar uh where um uh people have uh split up uh they've been married for many years or been living together for many years and decided to uh to part and uh they parted amicably I mean there's no uh great uh arguments going on and they've agreed on on what uh the property settlement's going to be. Now there are difficulties in in not getting legal advice in relation to your property settlement. I advise people that that look you might be uh friends you might have uh separated amicably but you really should get a proper deed drawn up by luh by a lawyer.\\n Explain why.\\n Well the reason is this Leon because if you don't do it the your your ex-partner can always come back next year ten years twenty years time and make a claim against the property against your property 'n' you may have accumulated a lot more assets by that time and their argument may be well look when we did that settlement back in uh in two-thousand-and-five you never told me about your superannuation or you uh w yih I didn't get proper legal advice as to what was happening you were overbearing towards me all those sorts of arguments can be used but if you get proper legal advice 'n' have a proper deed done under the family law act uh well that can then be used as a bar   towards a claim in the future by the by the partner because each of the parties that has to go 'n' get some legal advice uh to make sure they understand what the deed is about.\\n So you even if it was amicable or more than so you wouldn't go to the lawyer together you'd go to separate lawyers.\\n Yeah you would need to go to separate lawyers look I I know it sounds as though it's a expensive process to go through but the the way the law is structured in this is is the law wants to make sure that you both have independent representation that you both uh are able to to look clearly at what the other side's got and g and be sit alone and g and get that advice from a lawyer independently to say well look your your husband's got a superannuation uh of about five-hundred-thousand dollars you're entitled to X percentage of that uh you've got children so you've you've gotta look after those kids  uh all those things have to be taken to account so you do need to get some independent advice in relation to it.\\n Okay uh Selena wants to know \\n Right uh what criteria well look uh uh a number of criteria. The first thing you've gotta remember is that you've gotta be uh honest with your insurers when you renew your policy or when you first sign up for the policy. If you don't tell your insurers that you've been disqualified previously or that you've been done a few times for speeding uh then it's possible for the insurance company to void the claim later on uh and that does happen from time to time   if you've been convicted of a duh a dishonesty offence you should let your insurance company know because they might decide that they're not gunna insure you any further. So so ih people have to be very careful when they enter into insurances   it's no use paying out six-hundred dollars a year for car insurance if it's only going to be voided because you haven't told the uh your broker or your insurance company the full facts uh of uh of uh what it's about. The other way that a insurance company may uh try to uh to get out of an accident is if you don't co-operate with them in relation to their investigations. You'll find soon after an accident's occurred you'll probably get a phonecall from a private investigator who uh wants to have a chat to you about what's occurred now if you don't co-operate with them   tt uh that th you'll find the terms of your policy say that that that they can then void the policy again so bear bear in mind that you should uh consider co-operating now   there is difficulty with that because if you've committed a serious offence like if you've been uh uh in trouble for let's say uh causing injury by dangerous driving uh well then whatever statements you do give to that investigator can also be used against you perhaps later on if you go to trial so I advise anyone that's charged with a serious uh offence uh with uh driving that causes a accident 'n' there's perhaps people injured they again they should go 'n' see a lawyer to get some uh some urgent advice in relation to it.\\n Lawyer Bob on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh now a couple of other cases I want you to mention too that you've taken calls about.\\n Yeah luh Leon uh uh Michael was uh was leaving a car park uh and he'd juh just finished using his mobile phone still had it in his uh in his hand as he uh uh turned onto the main road and uh hadn't uh done anything with it 'n' the police then uh stopped him and accused him of using his mobile phone whilst driving on the main road and uh and Michael says well look hang on I uh I wasn't using it I still had it in my hand now the inference is by the police officer of course ih is that well if you still in your hand um you're using it and therefore they've issued a fine against him now he wanted to know what he could do now if he's challenging what the police say 'cos he says well look I hadn't wasn't using it anymore by the time I was on that road well then he's gotta decide to elect to be prosecuted don't pay the fine elect to be prosecuted and then you go to court and then you have to tell the magistrate um that uh that uh you weren't using the mobile phone at that time and then it's up to the magistrate then to make a decision but the trouble he's gunna have of course is is to is to explain well why didn't you put the mobile phone down after you'd uh stopped using it.\\n Yeah see Paul Fren makes the point uh from the police that touching the phone whilst you're driving is the problem. So you're gunna need to have a hands-free now remember with a hands-free you can talk on it but if you dial a number with a hands-free you're still touching the phone. So you could only I I suspect in practice   if you're in traffic or driving and you have a hands-free   you'd only answer the phone and be able to talk legally not to get prosecuted 'cos as soon as you touch the phone you're in that problem aren't you Lawyer Bob.\\n That that's right that's right  uh Leon it's look it ih it is a uh uh a t a type of matter that that still  not much not many uh cases have revolved round 'em as yet I think most people are paying their fines uh so it's gunna be interesting to see uh whether people will take on the police in relation to these sorts of matters but just bis bear in mind that y'know even just checking your mobile phone to see what the time is   uh  is using  using your mobile phone.\\n Hi John.\\n Hi um Leon. Um I just wanted to aks  Lawyer Bob Lawyer Bob um can a bank open your account I've paid off my home loan my mortgage I've aksed  for   um to discharge my mortgage 'n' that to close the account I've paid all the fees 'n' everything that they've aksed  for. Then ten days later they've um the solicitors rang them to discharge my mortgages my house p deeds 'n' that  and ten days later the bank rings me back saying that they've re-opened the account and charged me a seven-hundred-'n'-eighty dollar fee for paying off the loan early.\\n Alright uh.\\n Are they allowed to do that.\\n John ih what you need to do is have a look at the original contract that you've got for your loan  uh there will be a a document around somewhere  and and according to that document it may well say that there were penalties involved uh if you do pay off your loan early. What some people tend to do is they just leave a dollar in the um uh owing on the account 'n' just leave it there but I suppose that becomes difficult then if you ever want to uh uh refinance it with somebody else. But uh look have a close read of the contract uh you'll probably find in there there is some sort of formula for for of of a penalty for paying it off early. If you're still unhappy you can always go to the banking ombudsman uh and uh and uh have a talk to them about it.\\n And there is a free number a freecall one-eight-hundred number if you want that John look Lawyer Bob can I thank you for coming in today and also for the tremendous amount of work you do off air to help people out you've been an absolute bonzer person and uh everybody wishes you merry Christmas and a happy new year  and we'll have you back in the new year.\\n Okay look forward to it.\\n Okay. Lawyer Bob from three-forty-five King Williams Street at Camatta Lempens   eight-four-one-oh-oh-two-double-one. Are you uh you're closed during the public holidays.\\n Uh yes we are Leon.\\n Obviously and what about say the three days Wednesday Thursday Friday up to New Year and then   you.\\n Oh I I think we've got a skeleton staff on but uh .\\n Skeleton  okay.\\n Don't know who answers the phone though.\\n Lawyer Bob on Five double A and coming up shortly we'll talk travel with Max Najar.\\n\\n\\n It's eleven past twelve remember you can call us on any issue you like on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh. Uh shortly we'll be talking to Barry Urquhart from Marketing Focus about this thirty-six-hour constant shop till you drop. I'm just interested as to how many people actually do this. Amanda was saying this morning that there are quite a few people who do and if you're one of those people that shopped at two A M now of course uh I suppose if you go and buy petrol at two o'clock in the morning and you go into a servo in a sense you're shopping till you drop you're not just buying petrol you might buy a few other things but when you've got shops open that do almost all sorts of sales at three four and five in the morning are there people that uh will just love to shop because they work unusual hours. Let's ask Barry Urquhart Barry merry Christmas.\\n And thank you very kindly to you and all your listeners Leon.\\n Does this actually work as a ploy.\\n Well I suppose you've gotta ask the question why are they doing it and I've come to conclude there's two reasons why you would extend the trading to twenty-four hours and that is one to increase sales and two to provide sur service and convenience to your customers. Let me address those two issues. In the intermediate to long-term and the sustainable sales it will not uh uh it will not be effective it will be a very gradual sort of situation that will be isolated but more importantly and this is the ins interesting thing that's come out of some recent research that we did uh in Brisbane and in Sydney   what people are wanting if they are wanting convenience is not necessarily to have access to the stores twenty-four hours of the day what would be far better is and here are the three things they would want most of all more staff members in other words not waiting at checkouts more cash desks or registers available. What they would like to do is to interact with better-trained better product knowledge base uh part-time and casual staff because that's what they're looking for rather than extended trading hours and above all else they want staff of stores not to be using the p car parks in the shopping centres what they would much rather them do is to park out of the complexes so that the consumers can go in there and get premium car parking bays that's what people want rather than twenty-four hours trading.\\n Barry uh given that you found this out via er uh customer questions why aren't they doing this.\\n Well they think that theh uh y'know it's an interesting proposition a lotta people talk about being customer-focussed and uh Sol Trujillo from Telstra recently sent out a little note to his shareholders and he made a very profound statement 'n' I thought my God someone's at last listening I have advocated at seminars and conferences that you don't need to be customer-focussed you need to be customer-driven. Let the customers make the decisions for you now you don't pass value judgements on that 'n' I think that's part of the problem. People are doing things that they've always done they need to sit back and talk to 'em. See convenience must be tied to relevance and it's an interesting proposition but people're saying hold on if I want convenience I can go onto the internet. I've just received some stuff from the British Shops and Stores Association the chief executive's name is John Dean and he said that actually uh the retail sales through the internet are increasing and I'll quote if I may a hundred-and-thirty times faster than traditional High street sales and yet they still only represent three-point-five per cent of total sales so if people wanted convenience and they have access twenty-four hours of the day on the internet they'll go onto the internet they don't want it twenty-four hours of the day they want to interact with people what's lacking and you and I have spoken about this many times before Leon what's lacking in customer service in Australia today is one word personal it means more staff.\\n Okay let me ask you this uh we've seen a situation uh and this is uh on to the business of labelling where uh Southern Eggs tell us today that Coles buy uh virtually uh uh the the the lion's share of their product but it's labelled packaged in Melbourne for Coles. Now that doesn't tell the consumer where it's from don't the supermarkets understand that people wanna know where their food is coming from.\\n Absolutely and it's an interesting point.\\n Well why aren't they doing it.\\n Well I uh see  well  uh where are the decisions being made for Coles uh at the moment it's being made in Melbourne therefore they promote Melbourne I'm sorry to say that but it's kind of a a Melbourne-centric organisation that is centralised what we need to be is to decentralise you only have to read newspapers we got some gruv uh vegetables recently in Western Australia which were impregnated with E coli now my goodness gracious me consumers are saying hold on I don't want that merchandise.\\n Was that from China was it.\\n Uh that was from  uh Asia that's  correct now what they're saying is hold on this is about life this is about quality of life this is about peace of mind and of course the one thing that the buying agent and that's typically the woman of the household wants to do she wants to be able to sit back and say Good on you Mum Tip Top's the One and that implies that she's made the right decision women want to make the right decision she wants to buy locally and it's peace of mind purchasing what gives greatest peace of mind is when you buy locally and you know the people who are producing it because it's all about making the right decision.\\n So uh uh again uh if if customers vote with their feet and demand that there is proper labelling will they eventually get it I mean mind you the federal laws are going to change but they've gotta be policed by the state and as you well know compliance is not something with which state governments deal easily.\\n Look duh Leon if you sit back and wait for legislation and regulation you follow the herd. What this is a very clarion clear call from Foodland the independent retailers and the small specialist retailers and the farmers' markets and food markets right throughout Adelaide and uh even up to Hahndorf and into the regional areas of Murray Bridge and the like of South Australia to take the metal between their teeth 'n' say hold on this is an opportunity let's exploit the opportunity of being parochial let's really go out there and be serious about being local this isn't about packaged in Melbourne or packaged in Sydney that's not the issue let's start to have it as a marketing tool we'll become famous for it we'll do it in ow our advertising we'll put it at point of purchase and we'll uh see now there's the point 'n' I think it's very key if you put it in your advertising and you put it on your shopfront then that in an aisle by itself will attract people into the store. Once you've got them into the store it's easy the packaging will convert them and reassure them but what I'm simply saying is the packaging should be the third of three or four stages to really utilising that attribute of localism to be your marketing tool and your point of difference.\\n Barry thanks for joining us that's uh Barry Urquhart from Marketing Focus on thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A. Are you one of those people that goes shopping at one or two in the morning are you going to partake in this shop till you drop campaign which is happening just before Christmas. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh at thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A.\\n\\n\\n Hi Ron.\\n G'day Leon uh I work in retail for one of the big two chains and uh believe me it's the worst week of the year to work in retail but uh I wanna make an observation and then a comment. I remember you interviewing Roger Corbett three four years ago  and he pontificated about the creation I think f of five-thousand jobs uh if and when we sort of extended our hours do you remember that interview.\\n Yes I do.\\n Yeah okay. Now the success of the trading hours now that we have at the moment forget Christmas aside that   uh that we're open till nine o'clock Monday to Friday um now I work in a uh one where there's only the supermarket 'n' a few specialty shops  there's no accompanying sort of K-mart or Target or Myer where you can get a bit of   extra  I'll guarantee Leon between Monday to Friday there is no-one in the store after six o'clock seven o'clock  and as a result   of uh the store I work for or the company I work for where they're just cutting back cutting back cutting back on labour all it takes is it'll be about eight o'clock at night all it takes is a couple of people with two full trolleys and then another dozen or so people coming in with just bits 'n' pieces y'know where they've and you've only got two checkouts going  'n' and you've got a couple of big  full trolleys  and then you get the you can see the the the customers' expression on their faces going oh y'know now grrr y'know sort of uh getting  uh annoyed with it  but we don't put 'em on y'know wuh we'll put 'em on on Friday uh or   extra staff will be put on on Friday specially in say the deli section and the meat  department 'cos the that's the and on Saturday in particular but believe me these extended trading hours Leon I have not seen   people still do the major shop on the Saturday and even the Sunday's not really that big.\\n Ah Sunday I I've found even before Christmas Sunday  trading has seems to be quite popular  from from what I mean I've uh I've rarely been if you go to for example the shopping centres  and uh you do it on a Sunday  generally speaking there's a lotta people there . Lot of people.\\n Yeah you you get 'em you get 'em at the start of the when it opens at eleven and in the last hour  but throughout the week Leon there's no-one there between six and nine o'clock  trust me and they only just shove on two checkout operators and as I said all it takes is  a couple of people a couple of bih  and you're gunna have people waiting.\\n The the the the the shopping hours regulations as I understand them  don't mean though that you have to open it says that you can if you want to . So if  if the big  supermarkets are not getting the customers why not shut.\\n Oh but you but you'll see that uh   uh when you're part of a big organisation that they're all open till nine there's none of thih the only thing is uh our shopping centre because it's small  uh our I'll say I'll say who I work for it's Coles  we won't be going for the fifty-two hours uh in a row  business 'n' we'll be we'll be just shutting at uh  at nine o'clock at night  'cos it's not we're not part of a a  y'know a weh a Westfield yes.\\n W why don't the why don't the bigger supermarkets the ones with the big market shares go hell for leather in making sure that they label properly local foods so that people know what they're buying. W why don't they do that.\\n I I mean I'm not in management uh Leon I'm just uh like um y'know a  a retail assistant yeah uh.\\n Okay but but you you'd get some of the feedback from the public on that wouldn't you.\\n Oh I gotta say Leon I ih it's more uh I don't g I don't get a lot of those sort of queries they'll say d'you know where this is made and I'll I'll have a look over the package for 'em 'n' if I 'n' if I don't 'cos I don't work in the fruit and veg  but I'm talking about like your packaged goods  I'll I'll have a look for 'em . But generally I I gotta say that's not really I very rarely had uh queries about uh origin but I I've had more where people come in   and because you're a major supermarket they expect you to stock   or they assume that you stock absolutely everything that's ever been invented or created and people come in with some obscure  uh food additives 'n' and you sort of say to them oh 'n' I'm I'm pretty knowledgeable of what we got in store and I'm saying  look I'm sorry I'm pretty certain we haven't got that that's a that's more a uh  a a .\\n And and what about  what about the trend towards the bigger supermarkets for increasing uh in a large percentage their own home brand where they exclude a lot of the other popular brands that people used to buy.\\n Oh yeah you you you definitely you definitely see that and um a lot of the stuff is just the brand name but in plain packaging  um and ih ih the the dead giveaway is where the packaging is very very similar and the colour scheme of the label  is very very similar you're  basically buying the sa th the same product uh whether Kellogg's or Sanitarium or  or whatever it might be  I mean some some of it is uh clearly offshore  and it's g deliberately the label is very very similar uh to sort of n not to con not to confuse but just sort of uh.\\n Of course not .\\n To to gr no to grab your attention. But uh yeah um yeah as I said yeah there's hardly anyone in after six  uh you get I I perhaps department stores uh it may be uh worthwhile I figure most people will get their fresh food shopping done by Saturday morning.\\n So tell me uh are  the sooh are the supermarkets gunna be part of this shop till you drop thirty-six-hour thing surely not.\\n Uh noh not ours no  not ours but you'll find uh I.\\n I j I just can't see well I mean you can go you can already go into uh a a servo at some ungodly hour and some of them  have got quite a good range of stuff you pay a bit more for it but you're paying  more for the extra   for the extra  ability for the place to be open.\\n Wuh well put it this way Leon I know that the Target near ours occasionally  they have these midnight sales where it's dark  and my wife has gone just for the but she finds that a lot of people that are there it's more a social thing let's go out let's see what's happening  there seems to be a lot of people milling around  but no-one's actually really buying anything . Y'know yeah it's almost like  it's almost like in the old days before people had television.\\n We'll make it look  like we're shopping when we're not .\\n They they'd look through a shop window  and watch the ih it's almost like yeah it's pah they get the kids in the pyjamas it's all a bit of a laugh let's have a look around but no-one actually buys anything .\\n\",\n          \" And speaking of welcomes and people we love Ramona Koval welcome back.\\n Thank you Sandy it's lovely to be back with you and y you're right it's a great warm hearted book full of luck and fate and   fish and gambling   'n' Anzacs and if you'd like to have your say in the program you can join   our um online discussion at A B C dot net dot A U slash R N and follow the links to Australia Talks Books or phone us I'd like you to phone us I wanna talk to you it's been a while   on one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one   one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one   and also joining us for the second time Australia Talks Books Tim Winton from Perth Tim welcome.\\n Thanks  nice nice to be here.\\n Yeah nice to have you  back again.\\n Wherever I am.\\n Yes disembodied voice out there in the universe. Nice to have you back with us Tim.\\n Ah thanks Sandy.\\n Well let's start with a reading an and um I'm I'm gunna r I'm gunna be the one who reads this bit and it's gunna be such a pleasure  because just   just have a listen to how this beautiful big book starts.\\n\\n\\n What a knockout beginning that is.\\n Isn't it amazing.\\n And and Tim I I reread your book this week but before I did I tried to remember   what I could about reading Cloudstreet the first time. And what I recalled was the house that breathed in and out as if it were alive   and about the warmth of the families who shared it and about the celebration of a very Australian way of life   and I bet I'm not alone in that   and I wondered is that what you thought you were gunna do as you y'know got into Cloudstreet got into the house began to write it.\\n Well s first thank you but um no I didn't know what I was doing  I was honestly just finding my way day to day uh over the years that I was that I was working on it and um I suppose in retrospect um enjoying myself enough not to worry.  I I didn't yeah I didn't have a plan.\\n Tim what's it like revisiting a novel that you wrote over a decade ago.\\n Well it's a little uh bizarre I mean I haven't reread it um  un unlike you two I haven't done my homework   so uh I'm sure I'm gunna be caught out in in in in uh ih in any question uh.\\n There will be a test you know .\\n I won't pass the verb the the oral I just know it. Um but it's it's very odd um it's really I guess the only equivalent wuh would be be y'know an old photo album of y'know how you looked at school 'n' your daggy haircut 'n' the girlfriend who y'know only spoke to you for nine minutes of your entire life y'know it's a   it's such a long time ago. I mean I wrote this book in the nineteen-eighties. And I had a I had a y'know a toddler uh who's now   twenty years old  so it's it's y'know and and he has brothers and sisters so   so it's a y'know it's a very long time ago and it's it's almost as though   it was written by somebody else but I have to say y'know hearing Ramona uh r read it uh I there was a flicker of recognition .\\n It's got your name on the cover though  so it must be yours. Tim tell me about the creation of the house at Cloud Street it's a kind of house that we're instantly comfortable in it's big and rambling and all kinds of possibilities are there I think you said   it's a big sagging joint. Ih is it totally a house of your imagination was there ever a house like that for you.\\n No the the uh there was there was never a place um and y'know the the more I say it the the the less effect that seems to have I think people y'know seem to uh trawl about um trying to locate the exact uh house and I've had lots of mail to that effect over the years. Um someone actually gave up and just named a block of flats Cloudstreet in a in a in the neighbourhood uh just to just to stump everybody I think. Um no I I just h had I mean once I realised I had these two families on the go and um   I I I just thought about about how wuh h y'know would be interesting to put them together and I I needed a house so I had to make up a house. Uh and it was that's all it was I mean. The neighbourhoods are yeah the neighbourhoods that my grandparents and my parents um grew up in um between the wars and after the war. And uh that was that was all I was going on really a kind of a   a milieu and and some family mythology.\\n Yes es it made me start thinking about all of the great   houses that have touched me in literature and a a couple in particular I think are Georges Perec's Life a User's Manual and   and my favourite the wonderful bizarre architecture of the house in Crowley's book Little Big. Uh are there others that come to your mind Ramona when you think about houses in books.\\n Look of course Jane Eyre  you know that sort of gothic scary house with the  with the first wife um in the in the uh the top what's it called the top the um attic the attic   and uh My Mother's House a a a book by Colette that I I really loved when I was a kid. I mean it certainly Tim gives you a big theatre to work in doesn't it it's sort of like having a lot of different stage sets.\\n Yeah and I and I needed a big one 'cos there was a few of them. Um and and and and th later in the process I realised there was more to come in terms of um   y'know strangers and blow throughs and and whatever it's it's um.\\n And you had to have a shop at the front too.\\n Yes.\\n Yeah well  I had to have a shop at the front partly because the y'know the m so much family mythology revolved around my   my uh father's parents um suburban shop and um.\\n Wuh what did it sell.\\n Oh they just had a t y'know everything really. Um but it was m yeah mostly a sort of small goods kind of uh neighbourhood shop um .\\n Homemade ice-cream.\\n Yes yeah hih my my uh grandfather was a was a pretty accomplished um cook pastry cook and uh he he did a he did a mean ice-cream and uh yeah they were a kind of uh very sort of notable couple um in the in the y'know in the in the neighbourhood b uh between the first world war and and Vietnam I suppose so uh. And ih interesting talking about houses I mean when I was writing this book   I began it in a in Australia and then I I I left for the first time and   lived in in Paris and in uh in Ireland and in Greece and particularly when I was in Ireland I really did literally understand that houses had their own personalities and and their own lives and   yeah they just had to be standing long enough to um  to take on. Yeah and and y'know in the culture that I came from the suburban Australian   y'know  anything older than thirty years  particularly in in Perth y'know usually gets the bulldozer y'know. So um and I and I was also writing at a time when Perth was being n knocked over in the   sort of glut 'n' orgy of the eighties.\\n You mentioned Ireland and and that of co that m ma m makes me think about language and makes me think about   y'know wonderful kinds of language and you actually invent some really lovely Australian words at least I think you do invent them otherwise I've led a very sheltered life  in Melbourne. All these years   like water blur for tears and water lap and prawn kick describing the movements of a river uh are they fishing terms or did you make them.\\n No no they were just making it up I mean I was I was homesick and I was in in an Irish winter and I was in a tiny little cottage out in the middle of the bogs   um I w I was just I was just y'know m making it up I had a I had a an old um dictionary of of uh Australian vernacular but uh it just felt like there wasn't en enough in it to satisfy my great longing so I just made made words up.\\n Oh they're w they're great words and it it's almost like the Germans do y'know where they combine  different things and stick them all together.\\n Compounds yeah.\\n Compound words which are really very efficient. As you'd expect.\\n But they do they do irritate the reviewers of the T L S though . S they get a sort of brogue wearing tweedy sort of chap   um y'know from Merton College or whatever who who just y'know just cannot cope with the fact that you've made words up it's all y'know it's morally wrong.\\n Yes we t.\\n Well they probably had trouble with Joyce didn't they  as well.\\n Yeah that was that's probably a different story.\\n We're talking  with Tim Winton the book is Cloudstreet this is Australia Talks Back on Radio National in just a moment we'll come to your calls and by the way there is still one spare line if you're very fast one-eight-hundred   eight-oh-two-three-four-one   talking about the Australianness just before we go to the calls Tim   I think it was uh Joseph Olshan in the New York Times book review who who   though loving Cloudstreet observed that the structure of the novel was and I'm quoting \\n Uh ve very s surprisingly um it it's probably the book that's y'know been   ah the m y'know the the widest travelled uh uh of of my work I mean it must be a nightmare to to translate. It's only now uh just being translated into French quite y'know quite late in the   piece when all my other books are have already been translated into French   uh p people seem to take it on in the same way that um y'know there I was a boy in in Perth in the seventies reading Faulkner I mean  talk about impenetrable and y'know d deliberately uh opaque um I think if you can read Faulkner or if you can read at least a bit of Joyce then um the y'know there's hope for a book like Cloudstreet.\\n Yes let's go to  some calls.\\n I was just gunna can we  can I just ask one little little question.\\n Yeah go on.\\n What about things like carn and y'know sh y'know some of those Australian words um like .\\n If they sound like  they sound like other people's English though y'know people people kind of know what   y'know if you say carn it'll out loud uh in in the  context of a sentence.\\n You'd have to kinda  whine it though wouldn't you.\\n Yeah well I I did a few whiny readings in my in my  years touring the book.\\n Anyway let's get some calls Sandy sorry to interrupt.\\n Bangalow New South Wales first stop and Catherine hello Catherine.\\n Oh hello um Tim   I'm actually a teacher of the n uh the novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it reading it   but it's incredibly complex when   we actually try to explore different dimensions of it   from listening to you you may not have had any of those intentions and I'd like you to elaborate on that a little bit but my question is with regard to   the spiritual aspects of of the text which    there's a lot been ri written about it and I'm wondering if it's only on reflection that you're aware   of all of those um aspects to it or were they intentional   and do you think that you were talking about   an aspect of spiritualism that existed in that era that is lacking today or   would you like to comment on that.\\n That's it's such a it's such a big one uh. I'm I'm not sure that um y'know au Australia was a m a more spiritual place in the year of the um of the novel um from the forties to the sixties I mean I don't think Australia has every been a particularly   spiritual place under our current um um ah incarnation I mean obviously I think the interesting thing about Australia is it's y'know probably the the most irreligious culture implanted upon perhaps the most spiritual continent um on the globe and it's it's interesting and people like Patrick White y'know   who tr n trundled down that trail a long time before me were   were writing about the strange anomalies between y'know this   mm brooding ah rich   spiritual landscape and and a culture that was es essentially about shopping and conforming. Um I suspect y'know we're probably we're probably exploring it a little more now than we than we were then. Um as to what I was trying to say in the book I'm look I'm really not sure I think ih a lot of it was accidental I mean I'm   I'm not a completely unconscious writer but um the people in the in the books say the kinds of things that that ih that the characters I had imagined said and I wuh y'know they were just saying the things that humans say. Um some of those people are spiritual and   others are y'know   purely purely material purely for the y'know for the moment.\\n Catherine thank you very much indeed for calling us Catherine from Bangalow in New South Wales.\\n.\\n And now Suzanne is with us too um from Balmaring in Victoria hi Suzanne.\\n Hello Ramona. Uh ih it's interesting to hear a spiritual   quality mentioned because I've found it very I've found Cloudstreet and uh Dirt Music and other books of Tim's very earthy   very Australian uh and you've now two of you have mentioned   a quality in his writing that I find   and that is e especially in the early part   it is James Joycean. I I felt this is like Ulysses it's flowing the it was just a continuous flow   and I found that uh really interesting th were you aware of that Tim.\\n Um n no to be honest I mean I I was aware that it was flowing and I was enjoying that but I've never actually read uh I've never read Ulysses  and I've certainly never read Finnegan's Wake. I mean I've I've ha I've had a a look and thought oh my god this is y'know too hard for me . And I love the short short stories um but I I   y'know ih after the short stories Joyce sort of lost my interest the sound of it and the music's good but um uh ih it's probably like y'know for me like opera y'know you're you're quite happy for it to go on as long as the doors are open somewhere . And you can  you can you can make a quick escape. Um.\\n It's very Australian. You're you're writing uh can only be rij written by an Australian.\\n Yes.\\n Well y'know wuh puh well puh perhaps so but ih honestly my my influences um were much more American than I  suspect people realise I mean I I I really was a   I really adored Faulkner and and and I guess that's a y'know it's an American Joyce I suppose. Um   just that y'know at least in Faulkner at least f three out of five pages you know what's going on roughly  you you're sort of in the ball park at least.\\n Yes. Suzanne thank you  so much for calling that's Suzanne.\\n Thank you.\\n And Tim you've got a lot of water in the book so maybe that accounts for the flowing quality. M y'know you like to spend time on the water.\\n Your cuh yeah I I think I just yeah the setting coulda done the job for me. Um but I I think it was y'know I was trying to write um as I had been trying to write for the y'know the ten years buh before that when I was publishing all the other novels and stories I was trying to to write more and more and more the way   I spoke and the people that I grew up with spoke and the people that I knew spoke and um I particularly remember   ih y'know when I was in school th those novels that we did get to read   were tended to be even the Australian novels tended to feature a very very British diction um  where you knew damn well that the person who wrote this book if you met them in the street they would speak much more like you than like their book. And there's nothing wrong with   you know w with y'know changing your diction and projecting uh as a writer but for me personally in terms of where I came from and   and what I felt close to and inspired by were   writers who who whose l language was uh uh y'know even in a confected way which you have to as a as a writer you have to you have to y'know manufacture something but whose writing sounded like their their speech and the speech of   of ordinary people um at least in other kinds of people in the book.\\n Yes we're talking about Cloudstreet we're talking with Tim Winton Ramona Koval Sandy McCutcheon and you and the you in this case is Linda in Sydney hello Linda.\\n Hi Sandy and hi Ramona and hi Tim. Uh Sandy when you told us recently that Cloudstreet had been voted the most popular Australian book I knew I had to read it   and so I've only just finished it.\\n Oh very first time.\\n Yes.\\n Oh well done  yes.\\n'\\n And I found it a very special book and in fact I found many themes running through it   and I'd just like to comment on one of them and then ask Tim a question  if I may. Um well I found the theme of the search for an authentic Australian spirituality through it   and uh many of the characters   kept saying uh I wish I had something to believe in   and um I could see at least three different ways that this longing was expressed firstly there's Sam Pickles who believed in luck and uh amusingly his sense of security came in accepting bad luck as the norm for his life and then secondly throughout the book there are traces of a decaying Christian religious faith   uh Lester Lamb says grace at meals uh though quickly and uncomfortably   and his wife Oriel reads her bible though she wonders if it makes any difference to what happens to her and there are the amusing descriptions of the church weddings where the bridal couple and families are very out of place   and then many quotations from the bible amusingly applied to nonreligious activities. And now the third expression of this search for an authentic spiritua ality is a more mystical and dreamlike   even pantheistic. Um and it's expressed in many ways the unnatural glow on the face of Quick Lamb and his brother Fish. Um Quick's visions of water in the middle of a wheat field and thinking he's seeing his brother Fish riding across the field in a boat   made from an oranges box   and most strikingly and I won't give away too much of the story but the voice from the sea that responds to Fish's twenty year longing and tells him he'll soon be a real man.\\n Yeah but Linda what's your question.\\n My question is Tim.\\n.\\n I mean you've  you've jus you've just passed the P H D standard.\\n I wanted to explain  Tim um where where I was coming from to give so you'll understand the question. So Tim in Cloudstreet were you saying that Australians are searching for an authentic spirituality something to embrace that is greater than themselves something to believe in.\\n Uh I suppose I suppose I was I mean I mean and thanks for your ah for your um your statement as much as your c question it saved me reading the book again  it was a real good refresher I mean a as to it's te it's terrific I remember a whole lot of   things in the book now. Um  I I think I don't think I was saying something I think I was probably just admitting something and it was it was a kind of um the people in the book are c in a sense you know thinking aloud and um   and I I th yeah I think um and it was at a an interesting time I think yeah in my in my grandparents' generation and the beginning of my parents' generation perhaps   um y'know the sort of the mm the the imported version of Christianity had had kind of uh  had withered and there was no  real engagement  with um with y'know with Aboriginal culture and spirituality   and the only thing that people could really believe in was the army. Um y'know the first A I A I F and the second A I F and uh of course  in recent   years that seems to have been a resurgent um religious belief in Australian politics.\\n Exactly.\\n Um y'know from um Kirribilli down but um.\\n So you think we're still searching for a auden authentic Australian spirituality.\\n Yeah I th I think we've I think we're trying to find something that that that works for us and I think   that's probably not any y'know pure tradition I I mean I I was y'know influenced by uh my Christian upbringing but um  I think the sort of important kind of yeah the sort of ang the sort of Anglicised version of Christianity that that we had sort of only applies up to   a very short point y'know to your long white socks so.  The other  that's going on.\\n Linda thank you  very much for that. Tim can I just bring ih something else that I mean struck me talking about the spiritual thread through it y you make some very strong statements about   self determination and humanity and the the quote that I that s I guess stuck with me from the very first reading and really grabbed me the second time too was \\n Yeah and it's obviously it's coming from uh y'know the the matriarch of the family y'know Oriel is a just a   a sh she I think I describe her somewhere in the book as like a y'know little boxy sergeant major  I mean she's the she's the person who   is the least passive the least content um person to   to just take what fate um sends her way. And in a in a sense she's almost trying to y'know she's trying  she's trying to th throw herself higher by her own bootlaces which y'know is a   is a y'know ex er.\\n Difficult task.\\n A dih yeah it's it's a task that has a sort of li lih has its limits but uh it's just I think it's just a the passion with which she refuses to to take uh things um uh it it was interesting to me and of course for me it was   it was born out of y'know having heard lots and lots of conversations y as a bored child in the sixties under the   the dining table um particularly at my grandparents' places. And that that that that was the other thing I was doing   um in terms of language just r y'know revisiting the sounds of all those voices those sort of  disembodied voices uh uh ab above the   the dining table while I just y'know looked at people's varicose veins and looked up  ladies' skirts y'know that's exactly.\\n Buh.\\n As one does yeah.\\n Bored child that y that   that y'know and that was the that was what I was capturing and obviously I was y'know I was overseas at the time and   a little bit of longing there as well. But I like .\\n Well if you're longing to to speak with Tim Winton about Cloudstreet which is the most popular book for two-thousand-and-three at the end of last year when we asked um you to tell us about what your favourite Australian novel was and you said Cloudstreet   give us a call on eighteen-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one   eighteen-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one I'm Ramona Koval and talking with Tim Winton and Sandy McCutcheon   and let's go um to Sydney again to Jennifer hi Jennifer.\\n Hi um   I'm currently studying year twelve at the moment and we've just started Cloudstreet and I was just wondering if I could ask a few quick questions.\\n Are you doing homework .\\n Are you writing an essay.\\n No.\\n We're not  writing your essay for you.\\n No um we just wrote an essay on why we thought Tim Winton should have won the prize last year so I've already done my essay. But I was wondering um Tim what was the purpose of including magic realism like why why did you include it.\\n I I didn't make a conscious decision ah uh uh about it I just uh   I just enjoyed it and a and it sort of just it came out of the story that I was telling and once I once I'd sort of stumbled into it I found that uh it it belonged in the story so there was n there was never any conscious um decision to   to step outside the bounds of uh y'know naturalism um because I y'know I'd been writing in that sort of s sort of odd kind of hybrid way for for a long time. W in a w  when I grew up the the books that were purely naturalistic seemed to lack something about life t uh to me and um and I think y'know once I read at least in Australia once I read Patrick White I understood that y'know that someone else felt like that too.\\n Thank you very much indeed that's uh Jennifer in uh Sydney and this in also in Sydney is Jane hello Jane.\\n Hi um this is actually quite interesting 'cos Jennifer's in my class and.\\n Oh.\\n Oh it's just she's kind of just stolen my theme of question but that's okay. Um I was actually wondering if you could talk a bit about Fish's character and the kind of involvement of his narration through the novel and in the sense that it's from about three different perspectives.\\n So Jane sit down  get your pencil out and I'll put you on hold so that uh that we can just let Tim go for it.  Thanks indeed for calling yeah.\\n I think I'd better get my pencil first. Um uh it took me two years to realise who was telling the story um of of Cloudstreet so I wasn't really aware I realised that that the kind of narrator that I had was a little informal um he 'n' 'n' he or she was a little bit all over the place. Ih m n and and so it was it was a delight to finally be put out of my misery um and I think I was in Ireland or France at the at the time to actually know who was telling the story it was a l great burden um off my shoulders and I felt like I knew y'know 'cos um y'know being the writer of a book is a little bit like being the reader y'know you're you're not you're not uh you're not in c n entirely in control and   and there are plenty of surprises for you but   ha having having Fish tell the the s the story in in in in effect in the time that it takes him to drown um y'know it was a is a pretty artificial kind of uh structure I suppose but um it was it was what I it was what I was stuck with once I felt him in in the water and telling the story I w I sort of wasn't gunna let go of it. It didn't seem like a good idea but it seemed like seemed like my idea  and I was gunna stick with it .\\n It certainly works.\\n And it it is interesting that Cloudstreet appears on nearly every year twelve reading list in the country though   but it is it it's odd y'know those no it's a great book come on Tim I know you're being modest we all love it though.\\n No no I'm not just being modest it's it's y'know it's hard and hard to read and it and you don't write books for to to be obstacles in in people's path y'know in order to get their piece of paper at the end of twelve years of school I mean  oh I mean I'm glad glad of the royalties obviously but uh y'know it's it's.\\n But the kind of questions that obviously teachers of English will ask like y'know what was tr writer trying to tell us here or   y'know was this book about redemption and Christianih I mean all these things are really weird for a writer to to listen to aren't they.\\n Yeah and also they ast they they they have a sort of assumption that you are um setting out to write a novel to tell people what sh y'know what's what  uh or what you think and in a way y'know for me writing uh a novel uh which is a sort of habitual act for me after all these years   it tends to be more about finding out what I th what I think rather than um what uh I think everyone else should hear.\\n But isn't it isn't it amazing Tim the the number of things that a reader will see in a book and patterns and connections   that never consciously really occur to the writer.\\n Yeah uh and it's kinda wonderful really you r you realise that um there are y'know I mean if there's a if there's this book Cloudstreet there are obviously a lot of Cloudstreets 'cos they're they are quite separate experiences for people y'know and there are obviously many things in common and   people have very divergent uh uh readings of it and uh I like that uh um if if if a book has enough room to   t t to let people   inhabit it and br 'n' breathe in it and bring something to it and um and I th I think it's it's been some kind of success.\\n Yeh theh you are interested in the way y'know families and those in them cope with tragedy an accident where a man loses his fingers or where a child is drowned and resuscitated and   isn't the same as before   and the trick is to keep living. I mean whe when you write \\n Yeah I I think so I mean I I I I y'know I've I've had criticism over the years for y'know my kinda melodramatic streak there was lots of accidents in my in my books and um   m I I suppose it just comes from y'know having been a uh the son of a   policeman and and having been privy to and exposed to y'know a lot of a lot of accidents all all the violence in my life wasn't internal it wasn't in the family it was   it was it was uh around us in terms of what my father was   coping with ih ih in his job. Um and of course y'know I had a great uncle who lost his fingers in a   in a winch on a on a boat so um y'know you just you just use what you   what you know and what's in the air and y'know sometimes it's useful and sometimes it's not.\\n Well Reg at Saint Andrews I believe hasn't read this book and I'm not sure if we're gunna be very happy about but he he wants to make a point of nonetheless. Reg.\\n Yeah um first of all nice reading Ramona.\\n Thank you.\\n I haven't read no I haven't read the book y'know I I hear so much about it it's one of those things y'know you like a film   you hear everybody talking about it and you think oh God I'll pick that up one of these days but you don't. But what um what I wanted to ask.\\n Well good on you for holding out.\\n What is what I wanted to ask Tim   and uh reluctantly because talking to talking to writers sometimes you feel that   a lot of their ideas not ideas so much but a lot of things come from they know not where   I don't know whether this applies to Tim or not but what I what I was conscious of during that reading particularly during that reading I don't know about the rest of the book   was. And although I don't know Tim's book I know uh Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood very well   I couldn't help feeling that there's a a strong   sort of relationship uh between the the use ih in the way the uh words were being used   duh does is Tim conscious of this or or.\\n It's called good writing I think .\\n Yes indeed but  Tim feel about um Dylan Thomas himself.\\n Oh uh I've never read nuh Under Milk Wood I've heard I've heard uh bits of it um uh read uh on the radio or in the in in the classroom but I never actually st studied it or never   read it um from beginning to end but um y'know it's it's it's beautiful stuff and Tom y'know Thomas was a   y'know a almost as good a poet as he was a drinker.\\n.\\n Yes let's go to Jason in Brisbane hello Jason.\\n Hey hi there. Uh Tim I've got a question about tragedy it seems to be an underlying theme with a lot of your books. And.\\n Yeah sorry about that.\\n Uh no don't be sorry about it because I think my wife and I both love love your stuff. Um and you seem to write such beautifully tragic or tragically whatever way it goes around beautiful stories. Tragedy what is that a big sort of thing in your um like I w I don't wanna get too personal but where does this underlying theme come from. 'Cos  e every one of your books.\\n Uh well it's um I I I. It certainly doesn't come from personal experience it perhaps it comes from the sort of the  the the obverse y'know I mean I've I've led y'know a probably a charmed life and  it's either uh it's either guilt or anxiety that something  some of these kind of things are gunna be visited  upon me um . Um buh uh y'know ih but I guess it goes to y'know having having seen a l a l a lot of tough things uh as a child and as an insomniac I mean in a in a house where your father comes home   tells your mother things about the day that you weren't supposed to hear um  but y'know you live in a few asbestos houses in your time and um y'know they're pretty thin walls . Uh and tha and also just just being awake. Y'know I mean it's very hard not to   it's it's very hard not to see how how tough and and tragic life  can be I mean unless you're y'know completely anaesthetised by y'know um  muzak and and television.\\n Can't sing the blues unless you've less you've actually lived I know that's   obv you've heard that before. Uh but you seem to write tragedy just so beautifully   uh maybe it's just a good mind I guess what what.\\n Jason we're gunna have to leave it there 'cos we've got a board full of calls and it's bursting but look thank you so much for that . Let's uh let's uh put uh him on hold and uh just remind you this is Cloudstreet we're talking and we're talking with Tim Winton and this is Australia Talks Books Ramona.\\n And now we're going to Bruthen in East Gippsland to say hello to Mick hi Mick.\\n Hi there.\\n Yes Mick.\\n Tell us what you think.\\n Oh well I love Cloudstreet um and I love the vernacular especially uh words like Catholick. That's spelt really well I think.\\n With a C K at the end.\\n Yeah excellent. Um look I had a more general question and that was where where is Tim heading um in terms of his writing. Um y'know I love the way he writes about landscapes and um I was wondering whether um there was any plans to maybe come over to the east coast and uh immerse himself in .\\n In the rest of Australia .\\n The East Gippsland uh landscape or perhaps uh north Queensland would be a good uh good one as well.\\n I've heard of all these places um  but um. Uh e I mean I um. That's probably a good question I mean ih w I don't really know where I'm h headed in my work at the moment I'm just writing sh uh short stories as a kind of relief uh from from the novel and and as a kind of different kind of pleasure  But ah I mean I I just write I ah I suppose I've traditionally rih written about y'know things mm close to home and and I sup in a in a way I don't s think of the books as as discrete I see them all as part of this sort of aul uh alternate world that I have the   luxury of um of um knocking together over   over several decades y'know if I if I get a couple more. Um so look who knows maybe there's a there's a there's a Noosa novel in me but um. Uh I think I think the odds aren't good.\\n One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one is the number   we're talking with Tim Winton don't forget you can also   go online to the discussion at A B C dot net dot A U forward slash R N   follow the links to Australia Talks Books find the discussion page and leave some thoughts there. One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one to Metung in Victoria   and uh Fiona thanks for waiting Fiona welcome.\\n Oh hello how are you.\\n Yeah good.\\n Yeah hello to you all. Um that's interesting the the chap who's just was it Nick or Mick um from Bruthen. He's only about uh probably fifteen kilometres from me 'cos I'm we're we're East Gippsland people so we're   and and I.\\n You're all on the phone down in East Gippsland.\\n We are. We are   I would echo um I think it was Mick so y'know like could you please come over here and look at East Gippsland Tim Winton and and write some .\\n Is this an attempt by by Gippsland to hijack the man.\\n hijack .\\n Don't you understand he doesn't have a  passport for that part of Australia.\\n Listen we we we've got a cultural desert over here so we we we need people like that here  we need musicians and writers. Um.\\n Mate I mate I make cultural deserts wherever I go . Be proud of that.\\n Come over here mate. Look I suppose I've just uh rung I I haven't rung 'cos I read Cloudstreet for about oh fifteen years uh I or ten or ten years I suppose. And um I read it and I read it in one sitting. I was Cloudstreeted out when I when I'd finished 'cos I I felt it was a wonderful book   and my daughter who was then I suppose seventeen at the time um then took it up and read it and she did the one sitting too   and so we were both Cloudstreeted out   and.\\n God I wish I could write it in one sitting .\\n Be be handy wouldn't it Tim.\\n pretty amazing wouldn't it    but the thing was that   the the the weird stuff you know the the blackfella who was always lurking about. The black man  who was lurking about   and there was there was a particular scene that I've I've just picked yih I've been made to pick up the book again and   and look for it and was it Quick was um he was out in the water and there was a ih th th th there was a   a man.\\n Is this the day he caught all the fish.\\n Yeah.\\n Yeah.\\n He caught all the fish and the figure of a man walking on the water and it made him laugh. Um and he he sort of he s he said oh he's on a shallow bar. Y'know 'cos he's trying to get defensible. Um and this black man just sort of appeared and and when he got to the shore the blackfella was waiting for him in a pair of calico pants and a British  jacket   um I thought  that was pretty interesting. And then the black fella sort of lurks through the you know like again though the book and   um and there are these these really funny sort of ghostly appearances that happen   and it was really strange because I said to my daughter I found those bits um uh I like I'm I I believe in ghosts and things like that. Um but I I I found they were out of like a bit out of context or something or I didn't feel comfortable at I didn't understand.\\n Fiona then sit down s.\\n And she  and she  as a seventeen year old  said they were f they were fine they they they were real they just fitted in they were that was what happened.\\n Well let's get a response from Tim because we have as I said we've got a boardfull and that was uh that was an extraordinary uh rave from you Fiona I really enjoyed it . Tim how do you respond to that.\\n Oh I doh I m don't quite know how to respond I mean if it doesn't work for somebody then en I mean there's nothing I can do about it it's a   it's it's a f it's a failure in the writing or it's just a bad connection. Um and y'know upf obviously that's a  bummer. Um.\\n Ah  but the daughter loved it. Yes .\\n Okay let's  let's let's go to to to Ruby in oh no w that was Ruby wasn't it.\\n No no Ruby's next.\\n Oh the Ruby's ne oh Ruby in Maryborough in Queensland hello Ruby.\\n Hello Ramona hello Sandy  and Tim. Tim I've just coincidentally finished reading Cloudstreet three weeks ago. And you're a national treasure it's one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I loved the poetry. I had great interest and concern in all the characters and um just commenting a bit more on what a previous caller said   about   how you write tragedy so beautifully. I felt through reading the book that there was so much joy and love love of life uh interwoven amongst the tragedy.\\n Well thank you . Um I dunno what to say really um   Sandy.\\n Yes alright well that sound that was a very good response. Yes .\\n I just didn't quite know .\\n Let's g let's go to Tom let's go.\\n It's just so nice of you I just. It's like getting birthday presents.\\n Yeah look Ruby thank you so much for calling Tom in Toowoomba another man who hasn't read the book Tom.\\n Yeah well.\\n Explain yourself.\\n I I have um I'm meant to um at the moment I haven't read your book but I intend to.\\n Good.\\n Uh when Ramona read out that first starting of the book   within the first twenty to thirty seconds I visualised   that she was talking about the Swan river the in Perth   and picnics near Como because when I was a just after school during the late forties you were describing my family and picnics on the river in exactly the same way as I remember it. And that was quite a surprise  so that's why I rung you just 'cos ih 'cos it just struck me so. It's uh just so vivid.\\n Oh thanks it's it's it's all in the reading .\\n Thank you very much Tom.\\n Oh that's right it's all my fault yes actually Tim y'know h seeing Chickery Chick chalah chalah. That song my first publicly performed act in kindergarten  it was very yes it was  very good to see.\\n Damaged a h  dah damaged a whole string of kids for years .\\n That's right what did it mean Chickery Chick chalah chalah.\\n No id no idea I mean I I used to hear it a lot because my uh my grandfather was a a uh a uh in vaudeville well y'know he was a vaudevillian whether how far into vaudeville he   he was although I think he um he warmed up for Roy Rene once um  uh in in in Perth uh ae so we y'know all that nonsense singing and the the kind of strumming of the back of frypans and um y'know jumping around in baggy pants uh there was a lot of that uh in in the family and um and my my   my uh my grandparents sort of had a family band as as well and uh and my old my grandfather sort of managed to s scrape into the uh second A I F um because of music. Um he was he was really too old but he got in the band and um   and that was his sort of second lease of life. And for a lot of people I think y'know once the war was over ih everything went back to normal it was a very dreary place   um which you can see why they had some y'know religious beliefs in the A I F.\\n Well Susan's on the line from Mildura in Victoria hi Susan.\\n Hi how are you how are you all.\\n Good.\\n Good.\\n Um I read Cloudstreet and I've like read The Riders and I loved them both but what I want want to say is I'm not an academic and not an intellectual and I I absolutely loved both the books   and I absolutely adored Faulkner when I was young too as Tim did   um but uh prih he said he understood four out of five pages I probably understood one   but I still loved them and I still read them at one sitting and I still um   got so much out of them but I don't really necessarily feel that I need to to understand everything does Tim feel that's would he be disappointed if people didn't understand all his books.\\n No not not at all I mean um w when you think back to Faulkner 'n' 'n' 'n' 'n' I even I think p y'know people who who love Joyce it's not really necessarily even   um th information it's music that that people will take away and um   if somebody if somebody's carried by the music then   um then uh y'know that's sort of a feat er uh uh uh in it in itself just to just to sweep them   away. Uh obviously you hope to to sweep them away in a in a   in a faintly coherent direction but uh it's hard enough just to   just to just to m uh move people and um  and it's music that does that.\\n Tim can I can I just ask you something uh about the way you see the world at the moment because w when I r r read reread Cloudstreet that wonderful innocence of the Lambs and the Pickles seems almost from another age to me anyway. When you look around Australia now what are you seeing what kind of place.\\n Oh I I'm not sure how how innocent the the the place was and there's a certain viciousness to to innocence um at times I mean uh even the even the scene in Cloudstreet where   where there's sort of complete uh ignorance about the fact that um the Aborigines didn't have the vote and they're all sitting around talking about y'know which you you voted and ih the complete   almost callous shock that people had there's a certain   there's a certain nastiness to innocence um so I mean I actually don't wanna be too nostalgic. Oh I dunno I dunno if Australia's that much uh less innocent I think perhaps there's a lot of wilful ignorance but um that's not quite the same. Um  uh I dunno I think we y'know in a way we joined the world 'n' and had second thoughts. Um and I I s still think Australia is a y'know deeply conformist um culture and you look you look at the   the politics at the moment and you've got an opposition leader   desperately trying to say something that sounds different but really isn't different 'cos if you said something that was different then you'd be running the risk of   frightening the frightening the horses.  And you wouldn't want to do that.\\n Yes frightening the sheep. Yeah look  we've been  yeah Tim we need to wrap it up I just want to say th s so much uh y'know thank you for so much for coming on and spending the time with us uh.

She's also a compiler of a website   that is the holy grail of Australian children's literature The Source good morning Kerry.\\n Good morning Julie.\\n Uh before we get into talking about these books and and Marcus's marvellous comments   w why do you make such a huge bibliography I could barely carry it into the studio. What's the purpose of a book like this.\\n Ah I I guess it's best described as the equivalent of a map a literary map so it's for scholars and researchers and everyone who can sort of find their way through the field so   as well as this huge one you're looking at now there's two of similar size that   map the field from seventeen-seventy-four and of course you're possibly thinking there were no Europeans in Australia in seventeen-seventy-four but   nor children's books   but uh Marcie my colleague who did volume one includes books that uh that thought about um adventurers to this great south land. And then we go right through to the end of two-thousand well I carry it through to the end of two-thousand in volumes two and three.\\n And is it true that you've you read every Australian children's book that's published every year.\\n Yes. But that's not for the bibliography I just look at the books and describe them and and look at the artwork and so forth. But for The Source and for the two subject guides I publish back in the nineteen-nineties yes I do.\\n An and The Source is now on the web   essentially what's that.\\n Um it's a wonderful resource mainly for schools and libraries um for children and adults to use where they can go in and find out about books both Australian and overseas   and we're particularly dedicated to poetry. And so um for example if you had a v had a very harassed school librarian nine o'clock in the morning   and a teacher runs in I need some poems on angels for example . It does happen I can assure you. She'll just leap onto The Source type in angels in the poetry section and get a great list of poems some of them in full text if they're outta copyright that's just one example of the many things you can do on The Source.\\n Well Kerry I think your credentials are now firmly established  as a as a a gee whiz expert on children's literature in Australia   uh I'd love to get your reflections to kick off our discussion   on how things have changed and perhaps you could start with some of the school readers of the nineteen-sixties and then we could   leap forward to uh some of the more contemporary works uh tell us about the nineteen-sixties . Is it your childhood.\\n Yes because that's a really only one I can speak with  with any real information. I was at a large primary school in Wollongong called Keiraville public school.\\n This is south of Sydney.\\n Yes about eighty kilometres south of Sydney. Um it was at a time when a lotta people were moving into Wollongong so kindergarten I remember was packed out. We didn't have a school library we had the mobile bus from the city council library come around and I can't remember if that was fortnightly or monthly and each class would just file on and pick out their books I remember   getting the brumby books and um various others but you had very little time they just wanted you on and off tsh tsh tshoo \\n So th so there was no library actually in  your school.\\n No library at all. And we'd have class sets of readers and I've brought along just a couple of what would have been in the school and you said before that you actually recognise one of them.\\n Y yes can you describe one just to  to remind people what we're talking about.\\n Well this one called My Storybook Number Two it has a very plain green cover with just black and white drawings on it and it was produced by the Department of Education of New South Wales and the text is very simple it's um.\\n Just uh just read the first page.\\n Yeah I'll just read this one it's a little story called Pal. \\n Pal being a dog.\\n Pal being a dog indeed . Was Pal dog food back in the sixties  I can't remember.\\n I don't know this could be the origin of the name.\\n It could. \\n Now now we can probably break the reading 'cos I think we've got the drift I mean.\\n Have you got that  it's not too complex.\\n Well what does that book tell us about the world of those children.\\n Well this wuh I think would have been given to children uh around five or six maybe more like six actually because I don't really remember being given readers in kindergarten for example. Um so it was very structured. Um obviously written with the intention of teaching. And that was its simple intention   we'd look at them now with a certain amount of nostalgia which makes them more attractive to us like this one actually has the original uh a picture of the original model of the Holden. So that um sort of interests us.\\n It has a  nostalgia but as a as a a a a person who thinks so much about Australian children's literature now how would you assess that   if someone took that into today's classroom.\\n Well it would teach people to read in the end but it's not very inspiring  and uh when you think of the lack of other literature we had to draw on as well   um one thing that we had that was very very nih important was New South Wales School Magazine   which is still going and in that you had extracts of novels both by contemporary Australian writers you had poetry and original material a lot of   uh current writers had their start in School Magazine like Robin Klein and Anna Feinburg um.\\n So an important source of uh quality reading.\\n Yes.\\n And and are there equivalents of these sorts of simplistic readers from the sixties   and the enriching uh department publication magazine in all states and territories in Australia is this a common Australian thing.\\n I think so I know there was a similar Victorian magazine. Um that people still talk about from those days and and is now going in a different format. Um and I'm not really fully aware of any other states but these sort of readers were everywhere. Um I have another one called the Whitcombe's Story Books which were everywhere  in Australia and New Zealand. Um and yes they they just speak of a completely different attitude to teaching reading .\\n And and in essence what is that attitude.\\n Well it was just the basics. And um  I don't know if you remember learning to read I don't. It just sorta happened.\\n Well I remember things  called the S R A Reading Laboratories  they were all these sort well well f for the modern listener what are they  'cos they were I remember them in the corner and I used them a lot.\\n Yes I did too. Um they were just a box and it came from the U S and there were uh reading cards and you moved through levels you started at level one and went through all colours I think there were colours and and numbers.\\n Yes it was definitely colour coded.\\n And you would just sorta start at a level and I know in my class we were very competitive and we'd all try and race through the lot because you'd read a little passage and then you'd do comprehension questions do you remember that.\\n Uh uh very vividly what I'm getting from you is ih if we're talking about the sixties 'cos what I'm interested in is the change to now  and and what it tells us about our approach to children and childhood. In the sixties it was very learning orientated around literacy  rather than firing the human imagination.\\n That's right I think the idea of fired human imaginations was left up to family and friends that like that was a personal thing uh and so the the school wasn't providing um fiction as such and so at h you depended on what happened at home. Um I know in Wollongong we did have a a reasonably good children's library but that had only started in the forties like it hadn't been around a long time and I and it became better resourced by the sixties it was quite good but not everyone had access to that I presume.\\n Well well let's leap forward then  to that young Marcus the ten year old we heard  at at the front of the show.\\n What a marvellous reaction.\\n Well clearly able to critically assess a wide range of books to understand the sort of action he wants  even the sort of covers and topics he wants  what does that tell us about the modern child and the I suppose the resources that they have.\\n Yes well he just was so sophisticated in his reaction to he knew exactly what he wanted and he I I was really very impressed yes.\\n He he sounded like an informed consumer  now.\\n That that's a very good description.\\n Well well it implies to me he's got more choices it's not the  the van pulling up at the school that doesn't have a library that you run into grab a book and run out  he's choosing  from a menu.\\n That's   indeed that's that is the big difference with with the past and the present like now there is a profusion of books. It is um so much easier for children to access books and uh as well as the library specialist libraries everywhere. Schools I don't think a school exists now that doesn't have a school library it's just unheard of. Um and the the books are bought did you realise oh uh that last Christmas the sales of children's books went up twenty-seven percent so.\\n Well if we're speaking book sales that's an ideal opportunity to bring in my next guest Gary Crew because he sells very well   and if you've just joined us we're on Life Matters on A B C Radio National Julie McCrossin's my name and my guests are Kerry White   the author of a massive bibliography of Australian's Australian children's books and we're discussing Australian children's books and how they've changed over the years and what that tells us   about childhood and our approach to reading. And also joining me now from Queensland is Gary Crew now Gary   is a very successful writer give us your assessment Gary of the current uh choices for children when it comes to books do you wanna focus on a particular age group like uh perhaps young teens.\\n Um  yes uh Julie I think that in many ways that choice is um diminishing. And we could argue this diminishes because   if we take the analogy of um T V with um y'know real life T V what do you call it um reality T V. So one show's popular so we'll put on three shows so we'll put on seven shows so by the time you start watching T V at night you've got y'know the whole program is taken up with   hideous forms of reality T V interpretation. What happens therefore is often in the trade um a very successful genre of book um can grow and grow and grow like Topsy um.\\n Can you give me an example of what  you mean.\\n I can. Um you might get y kind of your books with bum in the title. So okay and there are quite  a few of those around I don't care about that that's cool I like kids who say bum actually . Um but what happens is while the originators of this uh concept m are are very might be very good at it. Lesser lights uh join in uh on that uh bandwagon and you end up getting pretty y'know crummy books as  a result.\\n Are you saying that we're somehow in our   marketing efforts uh reducing the sort of intellectual and imaginative content of books for young uh young teenagers.\\n Uh I think that's very possible. Yeah I do where I mean ask any teacher these days. Uh I think they'd say that they're fairly uh familiar with the expression of dumbing down   um of materials given to children. Can I just go back to one thing Kerry said which fascinated me um I'm sort of geriatric I'm fifty-seven   I went to school I started school in nineteen-fifty-three. In Queensland. Which some might think is a scary concept  but   we had the Queensland School Reader and ironically quite different from what Kerry faced in Wollongong in the sixties   the Queensland School Reader was squarely based upon great literature principally from Victorian times.\\n Uh I think Kerry was actually saying the New South Wales Department of Education school magazine was also a great source of good literature.\\n Well that's true. And do you know while it must've been dreadful for the teachers to have to uh excite a ten year old with that material   I mean y'know we we had things like um   Horatio Defends the Bridge uh we had excerpts from The Cloister and the Hearth for goodness sake. Um.\\n And can you remember your own reactions as a young boy Gary.\\n Well I I think I'm a freak um.\\n Oh but no we we  love freaks here  on Radio National .\\n Well I'm an author and I I lecture at a university. So I was hardly typical I don't think. It was the meaning of life and what Kerry did   say and I utterly agree with was that in those readers like S R A which I taught for twenty years which I did come across later were so impoverished in imaginative realms. The reader we were given was not it was just a glorious richness of literature. And I truly believe this is a great thing that I carry with me through my y'know intellectual and creative life   that younger people uh obviously working in a university in creative writing I'm teaching people as young as eighteen. They don't have. They haven't got that lovely wellspring of riches that was given to me through my primary school.\\n And Gary is that partly because we now target uh in our publishing industry the market of the different ages of children   whereas in my childhood uh I can say tell you in my early teens as a wide reader I was heading off to George Orwell and Graham Greene and Jane Eyre and all the rest of it.\\n Indubitably. Look you said at the beginning we'd like to talk about Australian stuff. At the age of fifty-seven I as I am now when I was little I had a couple of options let me explain some stuff. The Magic Pudding I thought was most excruciatingly boring thing I ever saw in my life. I actually saw it on stage and I thought it was boring right. So well that I'll handle that one quickly   but the point I'm making is this I had two options of things I could read basically Enid Blyton who's not Australian I know   but my preference was the Australian Ion Idriess. Now Idriess was a journalist come writer. Who specialised in stuff about the Torres Strait and headhunters and um y'know that sort of thing. His books were on the bed beside y'know my parents' bedside table and because there was such a dearth of books for children. Um I just moved to Idriess. And again I don't think it hurt me.\\n Mm on Life Matters this morning we're discussing children's literature especially Australian children's literature   and my guests uh successful writer Gary Crew   and Kerry White author of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography a massive tome and a she's a gee whizz expert on children's literature   I'm keen to come to your calls our talkback number one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven   love to hear of books that lit up your life as a child or your assessment of of books now for children and I might go to Lynn in Ballina in New South Wales good morning Lynne.\\n Good morning Julie.\\n Thanks for waiting on what.\\n Not at all.\\n What would you like to say.\\n I would like to say Gary at uh fifty-seven being geriatric is a laugh I am eighty . And I have no grandchildren uh so I know very little about current uh uh children's books. But there were two books in my childhood that truly influenced my life. Now don't laugh. One was Pollyanna. None of you uh may have read it it was about a little girl a daughter of a clergyman who died and all her clothes came from the poor box. But she could put a positive slew on whatever happened to her.\\n I couldn't live a day without Pollyanna  I just wanna let you know that Lynn.\\n Thank you thank you thank you Mrs Tittlemouse it was lovely and she taught me the power of positive thinking. The other one was What Katie Did  and for the information of your listeners.\\n Cultural cream.\\n I . A little girl who disobeyed her father swung on the swing in the barn and broke her back and was bedridden for X months. She was surly and sullen and uh uh put off all the visits her brothers and sisters made to her until one day an aunt came along   and said we have to change your attitude and ah she prettied up her hair and   and prettied up her room and uh put a smile on her face and Katie became the core of the family. Uh with visitors and flowers and so on. That was change your attitude and people will change their attitude to you.\\n Lynne thank you so much for ringing a and I and we'll cane Gary Crew for suggesting fifty-seven is old if you're eighty . Thanks mate thank you.\\n Okay .\\n We'll travel to Melbourne now because Sam has rung in with a with a spirited defence of Biggles accused by a ten year old earlier on Life Matters   this morning of not having sufficient action Sam your view. Good morning.\\n Well good morning Julie when I was five years old I thought Biggles had plenty of action. I thought I thought Biggles was fantastic and I was extremely miffed when this wonderful wonderful full set of all the Biggles stories was given to my brother who had absolutely no interest in reading   and theeh these books were deemed unsuitable reading for me .\\n Now I'm a girl who stole her big brother's train set Sam so we're on the same wavelength here but what was it about Biggles have you become a member of the airforce at the Australian Airforce after reading Biggles.\\n Uh no not not exactly um I I think I I I grew out of Biggles reasonably quickly but I think listening to some of the uh discussion this morning   it's just struck me and this is as quite recently now that I'm an auntie   watching sort of my uh nieces and uh nephews now starting to sort of grow up and getting to primary school   just how much when you are small the adults around you influence one way or the other   the books that are available to you. And that's whether they have books in the household whether they will allow you access to those books in the household or whether it's by introducing you to libraries.\\n Mm Sam thank you. Thank you very much for ringing in I might just come to my guest Kerry White   on that question because you you feel that these days   in a way we m over control and over influence children's reading. Can you speak to that.\\n Oh absolutely. Every book that was mentioned then I read as a child and here I was saying on the one hand there were no books to be got from school but I'd somehow got my hands on all of those titles and hundreds of more. I never went out of the house without a book. And I used to drive my family mad my I remember my grandmother and I'd be urging her to read the latest Enid Blyton mystery the mysterious whatever it was with the monkey and the little boy and so forth. Um.\\n And did you sort of range like a chook on whatever you could find.\\n Everything  I read whatever I could get my hands on   and I guess I did miss having a mentor you know someone who like um with Marcus earlier his mother led him onto Deltora Quest which he turned out to adore. Um I just went as like a chook pecking everywhere everyone's house I went into I would search their bookshelves. So I would go from reading um Enid Blyton to reading Evelyn Waugh  it was a very mixed diet.\\n Now contrast that with today I was at a home last night having dinner with a mother of four girls   who when I said this was on the radio this morning insisted I bring in   Sandy Beach by Bob Graham Greetings from Sandy Beach and Magic Beach and My Farm from Alison Lester these are   illustrated young children's books . Uh mad that I these must be discussed and it was very clear that she was reasonably directive an in what her children had access to.\\n Um adults are now very um uh knowledgeable about children's books. Um there's more professional interest in the area. There's always been professional interest in teaching children to read but now ih it's in all areas of children's books. I think it is over controlled like you said before I think there's children need to be given a certain amount of freedom in all areas of their life and in their imaginative life most of all . Um but it is wonderful that people are passionate about them and looking at those books that you just mentioned you can see why. They're just beautiful and uh everybody enjoys them mm.\\n One-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven is our talkback number this is Life Matters on Radio National Julie McCrossin with you   and we're discussing children's books let's take a few more calls   and then we might hear uh some readings from some more contemporary Australian children's literature   but Hazel has rung in from Melbourne good morning.\\n Good morning Julie I thought you might be interested in a slightly different angle   um from the point of view of an author because I think one of the things that uh readers do now is   they send fan email   but not just to the author because most authors have websites they actually send it to the characters. And I think that's an indication in the electronic age that uh uh books do cross the barriers um   um a as the author of The Hippopotamus On The Roof Eating Cake \\n Just tell us about the title of that book again the hippopotamus one.\\n There's a Hippopotamus On My Roof Eating Cake \\n C can I just ask you Hazel before I let you go you you're the author of the book about the  hippopotamus. Do you answer the the letters  to the  hippopotamus.\\n Yes I think all and I'm sure Gary Crew would agree with that all children's authors see it as a responsibility to answer I just find it a bit challenging changing um   changing genders and characters so often but um yes  it is a challenge.\\n Thank you very much for ringing in. Uh Gary I might just come to you again Gary Crew a a children's author in Queensland   I was reading last night your book The Inner Circle and I thought I might just talk to you a little bit about it because we can   bring in uh fiction for slightly older readers. This is uh well tell us the in in a nutshell what the story's about.\\n Well for a start it's twenty years old. So it's like me talking about wearing flares  so it's a bit scary. Uh it's about two boys one uh indigenous boy and one uh white city boy   who meet uh they're both essentially uh homeless or from dysfunctional families uh and establish a friendship. Um they become as we would call homeless today or they squat   uh in an old power house where they set up kind of life for each other and eventually um they realise that their loveless lives um have no fruition or no no no future at all.\\n And and t would you agree that it reflects that uh more contemporary trend albeit that it's a little old now   of trying to address for the young reader   the some of the tougher issues in life.\\n I think so y'know the remarkable thing um. Hodder publish that book now   and I have said to them don't you think it's past its use by date. And they the publishers constantly say no no no it's still selling. Um which is somewhat embarrassing but y'know somebody must like it somewhere. But it still addresses issues that are unresolved. Uh in youth. That issue of alienation for example.\\n A and a very frank exploration of the breakdown of a marriage and the impact on a young  man.\\n That's right and it happens y'know it happens all the time.\\n Could I contrast that Gary I've got a a book in my hand you may not have seen yet I think it's about to come out   Maxx Rumble Crunched and it's all A F L   uh footy stories  there's there's not a lot of words in it there's a huge  uh illustrations o of footy . A and it's it's clearly designed for the reluctant boy reader . I wonder what you think of these books.\\n I think there is a very real place and I'll tell you why. What you just said um about the illustration is hugely important   to particularly to young males. I don't want to really gender this conversation but there is absolutely any teacher will know any librarian would know   that young males are attracted to visual. So if we want to turn young males on to reading part of that attraction is to give them one of two things. Either a high visual content or a high intriguing non fiction content. E G psychic phenomenon um y'know dirt bikes rally bikes football. And I think that part of luring children into reading um means that they will remain there.\\n Mm what I'd like to do if I may is uh come to our callers in a moment we've got a b a b a board filling up one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven   of people wanting to talk about Australian books that excite them. Let's hear just a a a moment of readings from some very contemporary   Australian books and we're going to s uh hear a little bit from Paul Jennings also from Ruth Starke's Nips Eleven and Phillip Gwynne's Deadly Unna starting with Paul Jennings.\\n\\n\\n A reading there from Phillip uh Gwynne's Deadly Unna and before that Nips Eleven by Ruth Starke and a and a moment from Paul Jennings his Unreal series   and on Life Matters this morning on Radio National we're talking about Australian Children's literature   my guests are Gary Crew very successful writer from Queensland   and Kerry White compiler of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography volume three uh a series of massive tomes that cover all Australian children's books. And let's go to some of our callers Goldie from Ringwood has been holding on good morning.\\n Hi.\\n Hello what would you like to talk about.\\n Oh look I w um particularly as a teenager was a bookaholic and um I had a unhappy childhood and I just um disappeared and talking about books that take you other places I was very much into   things like John Marsden Tomorrow When the War Began which is hugely popular. Um a.\\n What's it about.\\n It's what it is is it's about a group of teenagers and they're sort of ah fifteen sixteen I think   and they're starting to be uh aware sexually and having relationships and they go away on a camping trip   and while they're away this war happens   and their entire town and all of the world as th far as they're concerned has been annihilated and um and th and or people have been taken away and imprisoned   and so they h set up this reconnaissance team and they are stealing tanks and   they're making bombs with stuff from their parents' farms and it's just amazing. Um and I lah I loved them also um Robin Klein and Gillian Rubinstein fantasy   um going somewhere else is important to me.\\n Yes tell me more about the the fantasy and why you found it so attractive.\\n Um it was that sense of um being in another place disappearing into a world that felt different that made me   feel like I wasn't where I was um and maybe sometimes that's a little unhealthy I think   um I guess in a sense I wasn't in touch with reality very much it wasn't a pleasant reality I wasn't popular at school my homelife was unpleasant. But also just that magic of that what if this could happen what if there I could be a hero like in Tomorrow When the War Began what if I could go to another world or find an alien and who's wants to learn from me another language and   all this stuff it was just   in intriguing I think.\\n A and Goldie how old are you now.\\n I'm twenty-five.\\n A and what are you reading now.\\n Um well I'm actually doing English lit at uni this year so I've just finished reading Jane Eyre an accompanying novel Wide Sargasso Sea and I've loved them. Um find them fascinating I must say I read um the Pollyanna books as well . And I read Anne of Green Gables I'm s  was addicted to them.\\n I'm just so pleased Anne of Green Gables has cracked a mention  'cos she changed my life.\\n Oh me too. She sh I I for me that was almost fantasy as well 'cos it was so different to the world that I lived in.\\n Yes.\\n Uh I've I've got a all the little accompanying books 'n' used to cook up her recipes and .\\n Goldie thank you so much I think if if if anyone's captured the joy of reading it's you this morning  thank you very much . Thank you. Uh Liz from Coburg good morning.\\n Good morning she sure has. I also remembered I read the Green Gables   Anne of Green Gables but the book I was calling about was The Family Conspiracy by Joan Phipson.\\n A and what's that all about and why of all the books have you rung in about that.\\n Well the I was my my mother bought me this book I think it was the first book   that I ever owned myself and it actually won the Australian Children's Book Council Book of the Year in nineteen-sixty-two. And it's um about a a f a a family a country family who   um need money and all the children um go on their little projects to raise money for their mother's operation. And um I think I suppose I love the book because it um   it it's about making do and resilience and and um children doing things.\\n And Liz do you have children.\\n I do I have four children.\\n And so how do you approach this question of of their reading we were discussing earlier do you direct it and try and shape it or do you let 'em uh rove about.\\n Well they do what they like now 'cos they're very they're they're twenty-five to thirty-two. Um but I read.\\n I I think they're probably old enough to choose.\\n I think they might be. But they I read to them like hours and hours. Uh I read to them all through their their childhood and they're all   um book lovers . All of them book lovers even my son who had a great difficulty learning to read   he loved books even though he couldn't read them.\\n Uh because you read them to him.\\n Yeah yeah  and he'd get his brother to help him read his younger brother to help him read and he loved books he'd ha passes books on to me now and says read that mum.\\n Liz thank you very much  for ringing thank you. Uh.\\n Thanks Julie bye.\\n Thank you Katie's rung in from Sydney good morning.\\n Morning.\\n You've got very prolific readers for children as well.\\n Yes and I was um yeah my older daughter is a an amazing reader and actually started to worry in about year two at school that she would read every book in the school library   which she basically did. Um I mean she didn't actually read them all but she read every book that she was interested in and end up hah having to go onto adult books quite young. But one of the things that   I really I learned when when she was little   was from my mother in law who just who was interested in teaching children reading   was just to expose not to be directional not to direct them into what to read although but 'cos I always loved the Alison Lester books and used to read that to the children   but she would go to some store and buy what a whole rae h all the Dr Seuss books or all the Dick Bruna books on y'know knock down prices   and just send them to to the kids   and they just there was just always this wealth of rih of reading material. One time she bought these horrible books that you could press a button on the side and a nursery rhyme would start to play with a really tinny sound and I just   thought oh I I didn't want them them to have them. But they love they just they m just read everything  and anything.\\n Katie thank you so much ring I'm afraid we'll have to go because you appear to be speaking to us through a tunnel   uh but I'll take one more call and uh then I'd love to uh uh ha uh have a listen to some of our classic Australian children's literature we have a little taste of that for you   but Sally from Sanctuary Point has rung in good morning.\\n Oh good morning yes. Um like Kerry I was at Keiraville school one of my many schools in the sixties. I'm a former teacher and now tutoring and I just wanted to speak briefly although they're not Australian literature in in defence of the S R A kits.\\n Now we should just remind listeners who may have joined us we were discussing earlier these uh   oh a reading kit system  that was in the primary school uh uh classrooms of the sixties and and some sharp things about their barrenness was said earlier what would you like to say.\\n The difference is that they were informative they weren't neccessarily imaginative and I'm sure that a l vast amount of my nat current general knowledge   and interest in in very eclectic interests   came from reading those S R A kits where you skip   with no apparent reason from why dogs have spots to um y'know nuclear power with no political correctness whatsoever .\\n I love that no apparent reason because I guess teachers these days are more obsessed with context aren't they.\\n Oh we use it all the time and we try and integrate everything and it's we try and attach meaning to everything whereas each S R A card was a discrete unit   but I was fascinated nonetheless.\\n Mm Sally thank you very much for ringing and I'll just go to Paul from Ballina in northern New South Wales good morning.\\n Morning Julie great to talk to you.\\n Yeah thank you.\\n Uh just ringing probably I've got the typical male story I read my first book when I was twenty-one . Avoided all the books at high school and uh the first book was The Exorcist and I couldn't put it down   and I've been a an avid reader ever since.\\n A and what sort of reading are you into now.\\n Oh it's very eclectic um poetry   through to science um fiction and a lot of biographies.\\n And Paul is it possible for you to   look back at your childhood and think wh why you were so resistant as a younger man.\\n I don't really know uh maybe it was a cultural thing a macho kinda thing but I know that   when my son was young I read to him every night I thought maybe uh he he might be different I'd help him y'know be a reader and and really he's never taken up uh the interest in books.\\n I suppose.\\n He's now twenty-two.\\n Righto uh well a question that interests me is what happened when you were twenty-one why suddenly pick up The Exorcist.\\n I can't remember it's too long ago .\\n Well thank you for ringing Paul because I have to say normally here on Life Matters when we have these discussions   our uh our uh callers are fifty-fifty men and women and it's been noticeably female dominated today.\\n Yeah yeah I know it's often the case.\\n Righto well thanks for ringing.\\n Thanks Julie.\\n Uh Gary Crew in Queensland uh I n you said earlier you didn't want to gender this discussion   and yet uh ih it has been a remarkably female call in hasn't it.\\n That's right. Uh a d a serious issue Julie is this. Rightly wrongly indifferently we find reading and promoting reading for children is seen to be part of the stereotypical female's nurturing role. And that is a terrible terrible travesty. And we've seen this in the range of callers I was so delighted I've been sitting here actually waiting for a man to speak y'know . But that is the case.\\n A and in your   readership are you  are you are you attracting boy and male readers to your range of books.\\n It is my first and highest priority. If I have a priority other than creating imaginative worlds. My highest priority is to reach young males.\\n A and is there any way your publisher can in any way indicate   who is reading your books is that a hard thing for an author to know.\\n Not my publisher that's not their role but when I visit schools that sort of thing uh you you know. Uh and I do know as I said before while that lovely little boy who spoke earlier who's name I've forgotten.\\n Uh Marcus.\\n Marc marc Marcus   uh spoke about action I hear that connection. I also do know that that visual thing um is the big thing with boys.\\n Wh what do you mean.\\n The visual element of a book illustration or whatever. Any librarian will tell you you take a group of boys into a library they'll go straight for Tintin or Asterix because they're they're visual they're they're full of like comic pictures . And boys seem to like a higher qual a higher degree of visual   and a lower amount of print text.\\n Let's go to Barry from Melbourne who's rung in I think on this exact topic good morning Barry.\\n Good morning yeah exactly that when I started school   at the age of f uh five in nineteen-forty-seven   and the first primary school I went to was till nineteen-fifty-one and the boys all swapped comics and they were currency. They were they were currency you know if one comic would be   two for one if it was Superman against Captain Marvel or whatever. And um uh girls read books and boys read comics and uh it's exactly what you're speaking about we were all attracted to the visual and uh I can remember Tom Mix and Roy Rogers and all American comics   but uh that was what boys did in those days anyway.\\n A and Barry can you remember the Classic Comics.\\n Well for us Captain Marvel was  pretty classic.\\n Oh I y th there was a series called Classic Comics.\\n Yes I do remember those but they were a bit too high class for us. They were English I think. And uh we'd we read the American trash instead .\\n A and are you a reader now.\\n I've always been a reader yes yes.\\n A and uh and would it be more books now.\\n Oh always books yeah  I I went from uh that was primary school I suppose in one once I got into secondary school I started getting into   my favourite book as a kid was Treasure Island I read that about five times .\\n I've still got a black spot in my hand right now.\\n Good on you.\\n Thanks mate for ringing in thank you very much.\\n Thank you  bye.\\n Uh Kerry White uh the uh author of this massive bibliography of Australian children's books   uh I'm interested in your response to that emphasis on   comics I mean in your bibliography would or or your work on The Source your website would comics or very illustrated books crack a mention.\\n Oh yes definitely   there's even a a genre now called graphic novels where um much of the action of the book is depicted in drawings Terry Denton who illustrated Crunched that we referred to before is just   wonderful at that he's done a series of crazy crazy things that draw on myths and surfing and interplanetary voyages altogether in the one book  and there's a whole series and parts of the text that you can only read through like these strange comics that bleed off the page and then go into a bit of text and um. I'm just thinking I think Gary did a picture book that was set up like a comic is that right Gary.\\n Yes Tagged.\\n That's it.\\n Steven Woolman yes.\\n Uh tell us about that one Gary.\\n Okay uh Tagged is based on a young boy who uh comes across a a shell-shocked Vietnum Vietnam uh vet in an old warehouse where he has hidden. Uh away from the world he is a y'know he's seriously ill this man. And the boy contacts him and the man tells him of the horrific experience of war. I just wanna get this in. What I wanted to do because the comic format or the uh graphic novel format so often celebrated war as the earlier caller said y'know in the fifties and sixties   I wanted to turn that genre back against itself to have a comic that celebrated pacifism . You see what I mean . Um I mean I'm a bit naughty 'cos obviously it still shows scenes of the horror of the war in Vietnam which is a bit seductive .\\n Gary I'm interested y'know earlier in our conversation about Australian children's literature you   uh bewailed the uh loss of intellect and imaginative uh power  in some of the books that are targeted at the reluctant reader   and I'm wondering. I suppose is it possible to have these new forms of publication  that are high in visual graphics that muh sustain intellectual and an imaginative power.\\n Absolutely.\\n Can you think of any examples.\\n Oh absolutely have a look at any illustrated book uh by Shaun Tan. Shaun is just Australia's illustrative genius and uh recognised throughout the world as such.\\n A and aimed at what sort of age range.\\n Ageless.\\n Ageless.\\n Which is the dream and I keep hearing Kerry say y'know spread this smorgasbord of books y'know. So when you get someone like Shaun and this is my dream too   I would like to think that my books were actually audienceless. And that you could cast them about the lounge or the house and the meandering wandering child could pick it up 'n' see gee that looks alright.\\n Look we've got a a a boardfull of calls we're coming up to the ten o'clock news and I'll come to uh some calls in a moment but can I just say   I just read Possum Magic by Mem Fox illustrated by Julie Vivas   last night for the first time which is a shocking revelation. It's about to be uh reissued in a in a twenty-one year version of it and I must say I was totally engaged in an odd way it is ageless even though it's clearly aimed at children but let's go to Peta from Sydney good morning.\\n Good morning um I I'm very been fascinated by the last bit of the discussion because I have three daughters and a son and I have despaired of my son ever reading anything but comics or the very very um frugal wuh books which are very frugal in words but he's just read Catcher in the Rye and loved it. Reached year eleven and finally read a book and loved it.\\n What a great one to click with.\\n Mm absolutely   um but really what I wanted to say was to compare my experience with my children's um I had the privilege of um being in Adelaide from   age six to ten and Adelaide was the best place in the ninety early nineteen-sixties. And uh I remember weekly visit to the Adelaide Children's Library. And we were four children at that time my mother used to borrow we I think it was four books maximum so we took home sixteen books every week   and returned them every week having read all sixteen. And it was the most wonderful magical place and when we'd read all the children's books suitable they bought more for us . And Adelaide library was the the start of uh really our whole family's reading   but um that was partly because you couldn't rely on the school library they had a handful of books and the public library was the place. What I found interesting with my children   was that the school libraries were so good by the time my kids went to school and they brought me books home that I'd never seen and I read with them um John Marsden and   and Robin Klein and uh so many of the authors that have been mentioned in fact what Goldie said was a repertoire of my girls read and it was just wonderful to read with them books they were finding at school and teachers who were providing them. And if I can just slip in we haven't mentioned Storm Boy um yet and I think that's a great Australian um in fact all the Colin Thiele.\\n And I should say to people if you can't join us on on the telephone uh today 'cos we won't get to all our calls email us Life Matters at your dot A B C dot net dot A U or write to us care of A B C Radio National G P O box triple-nine-four   Sydney two-thousand-and-one your favourite children's book and why   I'd love to uh have a little reading of them   and also you can leave a brief message please be brief on this uh number oh-two-eight-triple-three-one-four-three-three oh-two-eight-triple-three-one-four-three-three let's go to Shirley from Elwood good morning.\\n Good morning Julie. I'm I'm ringing about a book I have in front of me it's a nineteen-fifty-six edition   of The Way of the Whirlwind which was written by Mary and Elizabeth Durack and I can only assume that Mary was the writer and Elizabeth the painter   because the illustrations in this book are just so extraordinary and I remember as a child when I when I first read this book back in the early nineteen-forties   that uh the it was the illustrations as much I've been a reader all my life that was the story itself is also fantastic but   Elizabeth Durack of course did uh um gain a lot of um pos perhaps notoriety is the word but a lot of it media attention   because of her uh painting in the style of Aboriginal people um when she was much older but as a painter when she was young the illustrations are just extraordinary I'm looking at one at the moment   with two little Aboriginal children on the back of a crocodile and the uh illustration says \\n Shirley uh thank you so much I'm gunna just try and squeeze in Michelle from Chilton in Victoria Michelle a very brief anecdote I'm afraid how do you get your children to read.\\n Well ending on a funny note I've got a nine year old sports mad boy and trying to pin him down to a particular   style of book that would suit him I tried to get him to read The Famous Five which made a fairly big impression on me at that age. And um I have to laugh in the middle of the night   or later in the evening as he commenced reading the book he sung out to me mum mum what author in their right mind would call their kids Tom Dick and Fanny.\\n\",\n          \" We are Talking Real Estate on eight-eighty-two Six P R thank you Len and good morning to Craig Turnbull from Aspire how are you mate.\\n Good morning Harvey and good morning Perth the answer is fantastic.\\n Fantastic that's very very good indeed nice uh day it'll be a bit later on to uh go out 'n' have a look at um well first of all the uh Eagles probably whacking the Hawks unfortunately   but also to go 'n' have a look at real estate today.\\n Yeah great day to be uh in real estate ab absolutely I think the sun'll be out and uh not too hot and uh good time to be out there uh there's not that much on the market right now Harvey uh only about seven-thousand statistih statistically speaking and that's quite a lot less than than what's normally uh the case normally luh in a inverted commas average market there's about twelve-thousand 'n' what it means is there's a lot of competition for uh the good property out there. Uh lotta my mentoring students 'n' people that I that we deal with are saying Craig w y'know wuh we're putting our offers in 'n' 'n' getting beaten because uh the market's still very strong out there.\\n Yeah it is. There's no doubt about that still going s going gang busters really isn't it. And uh no sign of slowing it doesn't seem.\\n No uh it hasn't I look it hasn't been a crazy market Harvey but it's been steadily strong 'n' that's actually that that's quite good. I think uh overall um the rest of Australia is complaining that um real estate market's gone quiet but it's not the case over here. There's lot of indicators which uh show us it'll keep continuing Harvey I think all going well all things being equal that is. Uh and one of those is uh on the paper today Harvey. It's on page eleven  Perth house rents jump fourteen per cent  this year. That's quite incredible uh what they're saying is the median house rent now for a home is two-hundred-and-seventeen-dollars a week and um units d rose sixteen per cent to a hundred-and-fifty-nine. There's a lot going on um lot of high quality homes being built which is lifting the median price and also um there is been a sharp rise in rental uh sorta take up rates um vacancy rate's fallen Harvey from two years ago where it was four per cent down to two-point-six per cent now what that means is there's there's less homes available for renters to take up . And as there's less 'n' less available prices start to move up . Now at three per cent uh that's like the market balance. Uh and anything under that means r rents will continue to move up so as long as the vacancy rate's tight like that rents'll go up and uh people who are renting uh look I'm sorry folks the rents will keep moving up.\\n I was gunna say people who're gunna read this that have got investment properties are gunna say hang on I haven't put the rent up for a couple of years I'm gunna do so now.\\n That that's correct  that's quite correct lotta s prop lotta property managers out there will be going oh gee I haven't lifted thah lifted our rents lately  and in the next reviews they'll all be going up now what else this does is that uh it means investors are gunna look at this and go oh we can get a better rent return . Because the last couple years uh prices have moved up quite a bit but rents haven't followed. And it means that the rent returns f on the investment have been l have been low or getting getting smaller.\\n Yes people that have been uh for example buying uh let's say a two-hundred-thousand dollar investment property uh you should be getting y'know f this is what we've learned over the years uh two-hundred dollars a week rent but they've been getting around about say the one-eighty one-eighty-five mark now.\\n Or or even less.\\n Yeah and now they're gunna go like two-ten two-fifteen  that's how I read that.\\n It's completely possible  um the the Perth rents have traditionally been a little bit low. I think uh compared the rest of the country but it ih it is catching up  so um for those of you out there sitting thinking that maybe that you'll wait around 'n' just keep renting and you wait for the price of property to come down I I can't see it not in the  in the immediate short term. Barring interest rate doubling tomorrow night   and I'm not saying that's gunna happen of course but uh the the market everything everything all the indicators for our market are quite strong Harvey.\\n Mm. Alright uh give us a call nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two or real estate at six P R dot com dot A U real estate at six P R dot com dot A U you can call us now get in nice 'n' early as I've been exhorting you to do and um I'm surprised you've had time to pop in this morning you're a busy lad at the moment how's the s the seminar going.\\n Great we started last night I've got a group of sixty very excited happy people all learning about real estate 'n' themselves 'n' how to invest 'n' plans 'n' strategies 'n' they're learning stuff they never thought that that that they would  and we've got two full days as soon as I finish here I'll be racing off down to the to the technology park function centre 'n' they'll be there waiting so that's g great. I only get to do it once a year  these days um there was a time early in uh my education career where we're doing it four or five times a year but these days we've got our mentoring groups we've got our finance broking we've got our prop property find our project marketing and we're looking at some land investments there's there's so much happening for us right now Harv I just don't get to do this any more than once a year.\\n Yeah alright and uh you go today and tomorrow as well.\\n Today and tomorrow  two 'n' a half full days which is great so very excited about it.\\n Alright well I must pop into one of those one of these days so that I'll know what you're not ness I'm I haven't got any extra cash at the moment that is for sure but having said that just to see uh y'know what it's like.\\n What we do  Harvey you'd always be welcome.\\n Alright lovely. Okay uh Isaac of Merriwa you're welcome too to uh call us or you have. Good morning Isaac.\\n Good morning how are you .\\n Good morning Isaac fantastic.\\n Oh that's good um I was just ringing up to find out what your opinion would be about the northern corridor sort of around   noh or north of Clarkson um Merriwa all those sort of areas. Um wuh within the next say three four years. I've got a house I've already bought um last year and I'll probably be selling it about say another three four years when I move.\\n Okay so you're talking about Clarkson 'n' m and Merriwa.\\n Uh Merriwa  yeah.\\n Well look if you'd asked me ten years ago  about Clarkson or Merriwa I would have said well just try and avoid it because um when they first developed the area ten fifteen years ago there was they they they had inexpensive blocks and filled up by inexpensive homes and the developers at the time didn't put any y'know limestone walls in to level the blocks up some of them are like sides of mountains  and um they were all cut and filled and uh it didn't look attractive and the homes weren't the best available 'n' I would've said well y'know try 'n' steer clear but  um these days uh l like the the latter part of the developments have been really good  and pricewise very inexpensive compared  with what's around it like Clarkson the median price is only two-hundred-and-ten-thousand currently  a and uh Merriwa uh it's not much more than that I think it's actually yeah actually bang on two-ten as well so  what's happening is you've got Mindarie's been revitalised  and there's new shopping centres gone in there you've got the freeway being extended 'n' the railway line's on its way up there . So those two things the freeway and the railway will make a massive difference  to Merriwa and Clarkson and at two-ten-thousand it's now looking pretty cheap actually . So I think you'll find if you if you look at I mean there's there's areas within areas there's suh  some parts of Clarkson Merriwa Merriwa which are looking really good so that'd be a fantastic spot to hang onto  particularly with the railway and freeway o unuh on the way.\\n Yeah you don't know how far the freeway's going up do you.\\n Uh look I gotta look at my map here. It's on it's way up to I think it's cuh th Currambine now is the the railway that is. My understanding is they plan to push it right through well  way past that but uh  how when I don't know. Um  there there's talk that in future it'll end up at Yanchep but I mean I'd I don't know.\\n Yeah but they're concentrating on the Kwinana freeway extension at the moment  obviously but yeah .\\n They they can only do one thing at a time.\\n The railway goes all the way to Clarkson now the station's already open.\\n Okay good that well  that that's good news  and but the but the freeway's coming.\\n Yeah that's right yeah alright thanks for that.\\n Yeah so look I mean hang on and uh I think thah y'know it's inexpensive real estate compared to what's around it.\\n Good  on you thanks Isaac uh good little pocket up there by the way is a little suburb now called Ridgewood. I know a bit about this 'cos I well I had two kids living there at one stage I've still got one living there. And uh Ridgewood was uh part of Merriwa. It was uh the old Carnegie Heights estah I think it was Carnegie Heights or ss cuh Carnegie something anyway estate and uh Ridgewood is is quite a nice little sorta suburb within a suburb if if you like 'n'  uh mm.\\n Well look at the difference Harv ih with with um Merriwa Clarkson the your median price is at two-ten . Now in Ridgewood which is right in the middle it's two-forty-seven  and a half. Quite  quite a bih quite a big difference  because that was like one of the later stages  so to speak and they learnt their lessons from first the first part of that developments and it's ih done at a much higher standard and the prices reflect that.\\n Yeah. I was house-sitting up there uh for my daughter 'n' son-in-law when they went up to Singapore for a little holiday and uh it's funny because   it was only for a few days but you get kinda used to having a a good look at the suburb again . And I thought this is a l nice little jewel in the crown of uh those those suburbs at the moment.\\n Yeah very much the same as um there's a suburb uh in the middle of Currambine I guess it's not really a suburb like an estate in the middle of Currambine called Somerly  and that's been put together very much like um Subi Centro in East Perth . And uh that's actually looking quite quite good as well. It's still a part of um tt uh sorta Currambine and Clarkson but uh it's it's called they've given a name 'n' they've given it an identity and uh prices there are quite a bit higher than what's around it.\\n Yep okay nice little place to have a look at alright let's go to Como hello Joan.\\n Oh good morning Harvey good morning Craig.\\n Good morning Joan.\\n It's gunna be a lovely day I hope.\\n Absolutely.\\n Yeah it looks lovely out there um I was just wondering what suburbs like you were saying Somerly but what prices did you say they're about two-forty-seven per um apartment are they.\\n Nuh uh well they're  yeah there is there is an apartment complex going up in Currambine  prih prices starting at two-hundred-thousand 'n' that's that's right next to the railway there . We we said Ridgewood was two-forty-seven and a half as the median price that's the middle price.\\n Yes.\\n So half the sales were less than that 'n' half the sales were more than that just the middle price . 'Cos median price is a good guide.\\n Oh right the medium price  and that is in um the suburb is again.\\n That was Ridgewood.\\n Ridgewood that's  right yes. 'Cos they're all sorta new I haven't always heard some of these before y'know I don't travel a huge amount  but with um the rental 'n' that it makes it a little bit hard 'n' if they're students the young people um they trying to find accommodation because they don't they c it's not always convenient to sort of young people that come from the country or wherever uh or s perhaps they're from other countries they don't always have a chance to um get accommodation every um kind of as students there is always a kind of overflow if you know what of young people trying to get accommodation.\\n That's true and it's a bit of a challenge even more in the coming uh uh market Joan because vanc vacancy rate's very tight  and uh yeah it means rents are going up for it's evuh even more challenging for them.\\n Yes that's right but I'm interested in reading that book of yours that you've got three books haven't you.\\n I have yes.\\n Yes okay.\\n Have you got them.\\n I'm sorry.\\n Do you have the books or.\\n Um no I was going to ha um try 'n' get the first one I  thought.\\n Joan wuh there's three books the first one or the the beginning one so to speak is called It's Easy to Invest in Property.\\n Easy to invest .\\n It's Easy toh yeah that's that's for if you have got not a lot of knowledge about property that's a good one to start at that's a twenty dollar book . And then the next one's called It's Easy to be a Property Millionaire . And then the more advanced one is called Unlimited Cashflow.\\n Unlimited Cashflow .\\n Yeah now you can get any of those books any of those books from uh Angus and Robertson or Dymocks or Collins  um   or if you wanna buy all three together you could ring our office on Monday morning 'n' get a special package price.\\n Uh at the office okay.\\n Yeah and that's uh.\\n Are you under your name aren't you.\\n Yeah uh Craig Turnbull yes.\\n Yes.\\n So you could  go hunt those books out from ol almost anywhere or give our office a call on Monday.\\n Good on you thanks for your call Joan it's sixteen minutes past seven.\\n\\n\\n Okay it's twenty-four minutes past seven plenty of calls on the board Craig so let's get to them. Mary of Two Rocks g'day Mary.\\n Ah g hi how you guys  going this morning.\\n Hi Mary thanks for waiting.\\n Uh listen I'm just wondering um you're probably aware of what's happening up here with Capricorn the Harford Grove and Lindsays Beach . And then uh that's down like towards Yanchep and then there's The Reef the all those blocks are opening soon I'm just wondering uh a lot of the uh blocks down at the Yanchep end are those cottage blocks two-hundred-and-thirty square metres.\\n Yes.\\n And then that then they seem to go up to about four-hundred there's one for seven-hundred-and-four square metres 'n' then a couple of two-thousand. I don't know what's gunna happen with The Reef but I'm just wondering how do you think this will affect uh like we're in Two Rocks we're in the yachting village. Would that tend to put the values up or drop them a bit. When all that development happens.\\n I would tend to think Mary that that would increase values 'n' I'll tell you why. Um people who are buying the smaller blocks um oh actuh all those those homes that'll be built there will probably be pretty high quality  and depending on the covenants that the the developers have put on the on the land um uh I would think that that you've gotta build a certain quality and certain size home so what that tends to to do is lift the overall quality uh of housing in the area so uh uh prices will follow so.\\n Right ih.\\n I l I I think Yanchep and Two Rocks really needs that kind of developmys  myself.\\n Yes uh what do you think uh do you know anything about what's happening with The Reef that's that's right uh on the border on the uh farmlands at Two Rocks there.\\n Mary I don't I I really don't.\\n No.\\n No I'm sorry.\\n Alright then.\\n Okay Mary thank you uh let's go to Abe of Rivervale hello Abe.\\n How're ya good morning gentlemen um  just just a question about uh we're looking to buy a property for the family to live in ourselves and uh we're looking at the suburb of Lynwood. What uh what are we what would we be looking at in terms of paying for a home there a three by one or a three by two.\\n Ih good question um the median price in Lynwood as at March was two-hundred-'n'-five-thousand we're waiting for the June figures out 'n' I suspect Lynwood would have jumped quite a bit. Um two-oh-five sounds very very very very very cheap and I I think that that's got some real up upside in it compared to like what's around it like Langford's one-eighty-two uh you got other areas um Parkwood around it um y'know higher again than that so I think Lynwood's looking pretty cheap right now. Other thing with Lynwood is um the Lynwood Arms is gunna be I think part of it gunna be taken down and uh brand new townhouses're gunna be built there um Abe Saffron's just got that underway 'n' those townhouses'll be in a b sorta three-hundred-thousand plus price bracket so I I think that um Lynwood is great value so you probably looking probably for an like an like an average home in a good condition in Lynwood probably two-twenty to two-fifty I'd say something in in that range.\\n Right right  excellent.\\n Yeah is that that work for you.\\n Yeah wuh well we've looked at a couple 'n' we're there's one that's a like a more of a an older home nineteens-fifties that's in our price range roughly and but it's on a big block like a nine-hundred square metre block.\\n Yes.\\n And uh they're the price would I'm just trying to find out what whether these p whether they're inflating the price or if it's reasonable they're looking at about two-thirty two-hundred-'n'-thirty-thousand for the home it's a three by two. So it's an older.\\n Is there much mah much work to do on the home Abe.\\n Um just just uh the roof needs to be replaced probably 'cos it's asbestos . But it's a it's a solid brick uh brick home uh floor tiles are it's painted it's already painted floor tile uh the it's got dark wooden floorboards uh and and a big uh backyard with a  with a with a uh concrete pool cement pool in it.\\n Eh but it's not it's not bad value just get that roof changed 'n' and you'll be set I think.\\n Right excellent  okay thanks very much.\\n You're welcome matey . Let's head off to Kenwick g'day Christine.\\n Oh good morning uh  I'd uh I'd just like to know about the values in Kenwick I heard you speaking about the one on Anaconda Drive in in um Gosnells. My place is about the same sound sounded about the same anyway. But we have a granny flat instead of the workshop. So I I just wondered where we were in Kenwick.\\n Okay well median price that's the middle price in Kenwick uh as of March was a hundred-'n'-seventy-six-thousand. The lowest price was a hundred-'n'-sixty-seven so there's obviously a lot of lotta homes being sold in that price bracket and the the high price is five-hundred-'n'-fifty. Lotta activity out in Kenwick uh at the moment um uh t to get anything decent uh is getting much much harder under two-hundred-thousand these days.\\n Yeah we  we keep getting real estate people offering to sell .\\n Of course yeah because th they're all chasing listings 'cos there isn't much available out there so um people putting their homes on the market right now are starting to get y'know pretty good prices. Where you'd be look I don't know without seeing your property but I'd certainly say two-hundred plus but how far more than that I just don't know without seeing it so get get three appraisals written appraisals 'n' see what they say.\\n Yeah.\\n And oh  the highest one isn't always the best Christine.\\n Thanks Christine ah before the headlines Carl of Maylands g'day Carl.\\n Yeah g'day Craig and Harvey how you going.\\n Fantastic Carl.\\n Uh just want to ask you Craig uh what you know about the Mangles Bay development down there at Rockingham.\\n Carl absolutely nothing . Where where is it.\\n It's uh it's heading towards y'know that the bridge that goes across to Garden Island.\\n Yes I know the bridge very well.\\n If you go onto the um Rockingham Development Authority's uh website there's something on there about Mangles Bay 'n' they're putting forward proposals to build a marina there and possibly c uh canals I think.\\n Sorry now I know where you're talking about yeah  look look I I have heard of it but they're facing some stiff opposition from the locals  uh environmentals um and so on but uh there's a big push behind that particular section and in time it it will happen I think it should happen given that they can take care of all the environmental side of things  um I think it would really help uh Rockingham uh go ahead so keep your eye on that   the way to make money outta that kind of uh development is to get in there beforehand it's a risk because it's not a given it may or may not happen  mm but there's a bit of a a y'know there's a strong push behind that one so I I suspect in time ih it'll go ahead but I mean I I don't know for sure.\\n Okay I've actually got a townhouse down there at Palm Beach so you think it's worth holding onto.\\n Oh yes . Absolutely yeah yeah hang on to that one.\\n Great thank you for that.\\n Cheers.\\n Good on you Carl thank you for your call bye.\\n Bye.\\n\\n\\n Worth waiting for wasn't it twenty-four minutes to eight o'clock nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two or real estate at six P R dot com dot A U. We've got Riaz has sent us a an email which we'll get to in a minute but Tony of Darch has been waiting on forever on the phone g'day Tony.\\n How's it going.\\n Good.\\n Hi Tony.\\n Hi how's it going I was just wanting to ask you a question um have you heard of a estate in Stirling called civling guh Civic Gardens Estate.\\n Uh that's just right next to the um the old council building yes.\\n Yeah that one there what do you reckon about that that's that little bit of l that little pocket there.\\n Well uh uh  I th yeah.\\n Blocks are about three-hundred-and-eighty square metres.\\n Yes.\\n And you have to put the the garages at the back 'n' the actual y'know no garage at the front but thah garah like a Subi Centro style.\\n Yes.\\n With the little laneway at the back what do you  what what'd something be worth   what would the house be worth at the end of the day when it's all done . The blocks are about two-twenty to buy.\\n Yes.\\n 'N' then you gotta put ih and you can't put single-storey you have to go up on three-hundred-'n'-eighty square metres.\\n Yeah uh what then what you'll find is then that uh  your prices probably end up between four five-hundred-thousand something like that. Um and look that little pocket of land there is like it really   for all intents and purposes shouldn't be residential it's like it's been created out of out of nothing and uh to get land like that in the middle of Stirling uh is not an easy thing to do and you will find that um creating land like that is is kind of unique and that's why they're they can get the prices they want it's r y'know just back from the freeway you're not far from y'know Karrinyup shopping centre y'know ten minutes from the beach you've ten minutes from town I think locationwise it's it's pretty good and uh what they are creating there is a high quality subdivision that'll uh be uh wuh will attract uh big houses 'n' people wih with big wallets so I think that uh if it is built the way I think it's gunna be built it could be terrific pih piece of real estate.\\n Thank you very much indeed Tony uh Riaz as I said wrote to us. \\n Look I don't know what the exact prices are uh in Settlers Hill but uh Baldivis the the median prices are just jumping like crazy which is quite incredible. Um y we're looking at around about three-hundred-'n'-twenty-five-thousand as a median price 'n' that's what I mean the blocks are probably one-thirty to one-sixty kind of in that range 'n' then you're spending that again on a home so y with three-hundred three-twenty-thousand for ol almost like a first home out there. Most of 'em are being built four by two quite big homes and and mm ih they're all relatively high quality. Uh but Baldivis for mine 'n' Settlers Hill it sort of   I don't know it seems like a long way from anywhere for me. For mine um not down near the water it's just off the freeway I guess it's only like like a half hour trip into town. But uh I'm I'm not quite sure why the the prices are suh are so high there it's just  it's beyond me actually.\\n Okay uh Paul of Connolly g'day Paul.\\n Yeah g'day guys how are youse.\\n Hey  Paul.\\n Um yeah we just got a um uh situation we had couple of investment properties and our place um in Heathridge and we've sold one of the investment properties and our place and moved to um Connolly uh we've still got our investment property in Scarborough I was just didn't know whether we'd be best off um selling that   'cos all the equity's sort of in in the um the unit we've got in Scarborough   selling that 'n' sort of putting the money back into our own place 'n' then buying another investment property . Which we can fully negative gear.\\n Yeah good question um there's a lotta things to s consider there number one what tax will you pay if if and when you pa you sell Scarborough that's one thing to consider. Um at the moment if you've got a big loan on Connolly and no loan on the Scarborough property well that's all back to front. Ideally as you put it uh you all your debt you want against property you're renting out so it's all tax-deductible so that's ideal.\\n Yeah just tha tha tha that's the situation we've got where you don't know   you're looking at paying about thirty-thousand capital gains tax if we sell the unit in Scarborough.\\n Yeah so how much is that gunna hurt you versus what you'll save  if you sold Scarborough used that money to pay your own home in Connolly off and then used the equity in Connolly to go again  um it it's a matter of sitting down and working the numbers Paul and perhaps getting some some accounting advice.\\n Yeah where can you go to get accuh accounting advice 'cos I mean I've I've tried to find people 'n' they always try and sell you either houses or a development they're doing or they um.\\n Okay.\\n Know what I mean it's like there's no one out there who actually does that sort there's not that I can find anyway.\\n Yeah look there you're you're right there're very few but look these days to survive in business you've gotta have more than one uh arrow ih in your quiver 'n' that's what what um suh the added value services are all about. Um look any number of ways you c you could look at it but if you want to know who my accountant is y would you like to know that or.\\n Yeah yeah.\\n Yeah guy named Nigel Plowman and he operates  his company's called McKinley Plowman  and they're up at Joondalup and.\\n actually.\\n Oh is he.\\n Yeah believe it or not.\\n Go and talk to Nigel I mean.\\n Oh well we ee sort of wih went and spoke to Nigel once before 'n' he sort of um put onto one of his uh um accountants that works for him sorta thing.\\n Okay.\\n But yeah no I'll I will do that then.\\n Yeah look sm smart fella smart company and uh he could give you some suggestions but uh I mean sit down and work it out for yourself I mean you you sound like a smart fella to me work the numbers and theh see what wha the best bet.\\n Yeah cool not a problem.\\n Cheers.\\n Thanks Paul.\\n Thank you see ya.\\n Okay Irene Mossie Park g'day Irene.\\n Uh good a good morning.\\n Hi Irene.\\n Hello.\\n Yes Irene what can we do for you.\\n Okay um I live in Mosman Park but my daughter is looking to buy a property in Cannington and I have absolutely no idea how to work out the prices this ih this is a vacant lot of four-hundred-'n'-ninety-eight square metres um adjoining recreation reserve on river frontage and they want three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand . Um because there's no history there of the h of a house being there 'n' it being sold previously how do you tell whether three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand is a reasonable price.\\n Yeah good question that's a really tough one my my first instinct is that's a lotta money . A five-hundred square metre block in Cannington a vacant block you'd probably buy like a an ordinary one for about one-fifty one-sixty maybe  a a a v a vacant block of that size  but if it's like at a premium location there aren't many blocks like it available down on the riverside there you may well get more. Three-fifty sounds like a lotta money to me.\\n Yeah  that's what I that was my first instinct.\\n Yeah the the only way to uh really compare is to find some some other riverside lots like  maybe over at Wilson or depends on wuh y'know somewhere nearby  um very challenging to price something where there's nuh no other comparables and pretty much what the developers have gone is well this is unique  I'm gunna price it up at whatever I like 'n' 'n' y'know whoever if they wanna live there they'll they'll pay for it . To me it sounds like a lotta money.\\n Okay. Okay thank you.\\n Thanks Irene.\\n Bye.\\n Okay Irene thank you very much indeed uh who's next might be Susie at Herne Hill g'day Susie.\\n Hi.\\n Good morning Susie.\\n Hi um I've just been given some um information about some blocks at Jurien Bay. They're house blocks and there's no time to build on 'em. What would be um like if I was to buy one and sell it without building on it would that be worth it.\\n It depends on whether you can make a profit on it or not.\\n Yeah I mean that's what I mean uh what's the aerh y'know is that area like uh I mean it's miles away y'know.\\n Yeah it is Jurien's certainly moving though. There is a a few land subdivisions opening up there in anticipation of the that inner coastal road opening up 'n' when that does that's gunna make it more uh attractive to Perth people. I mean  it's closer than than um than Busselton-Dunsborough and every bit as attractive if you like the beach 'n' have been fishing 'n' that. Um and prices are are a loh are a lot cheaper I guess but uh y'know look whether or not you'd make a profit immediately will depend on how much land's available and what the demand is Susie just be careful  do some research and don't jump in in too much of a hurry okay.\\n Okay then.\\n Good luck.\\n Thank you  Susie.\\n Bye.\\n Bye seventeen to eight.\\n\\n\\n Thirteen minutes to eight and uh plenty of calls on the board still Roger of Padbury g'day Rog.\\n Yeah morning Harvey 'n' Craig.\\n Good morning Roger.\\n Um   I've got a suh scenario Craig um where   um I've been transferred down uh to a country area and uh I'm living in the house my house at the moment which I nearly own. And uh I've got a a residential uh another residential property which I owe very little on and a commercial property which is positively geared. Now I've just bought another property uh in the um in the country area which I have to live in so there's no tax deduction for me there um I'm just wondering y'know sorta where do I go from here I've got approximate borrowings of five-sixty and approximate values of eight-ninety-six.\\n Okay so what you're asking me is there uh room for you to luh invest some more property or is or is that what you.\\n Yeah yeah basically um yeah what sort of what what sort of uh area can I go into now where I can hopefully y'know get some sorta tax deduction 'cos I'm just gunna beh be paying uh too much tax probably on my rents 'n' that.\\n Alright well first thing about paying paying tax is it's great because number one it means you're breathing 'n' number two it means you're making a profit  so don't be too worried about it and there are laws for anyone anyone can use them to lower their tax so um first thing is to sit down and figure out where you're at now figure out where you wanna be in ten years from now and then work backwards 'n' if then follow a plan. One thing I've been teaching uh everyone at the seminar um I'm doing this weekend is make a plan. Alright sounds like you got the beginning of like yeah you know you wanna y'know look after yourself in the future but create a strong plan Roger 'n' then start working forward from there. It's a matter of finding out what it is you want what's right for you you got a couple of residential properties you got one commercial one and yeah look clearly figure out uh what kinda property fits in your portfolio and then go and buy some. Um do some great research make a plan and um make a good purchase so nothing wrong with that get my books I mean mm   really inexpensive go into or call our office on one-three-hundred-one-three-two-nine-four-one or any good bookstore and that'll give you some idea where to aim so make a plan is the is the most important thing I I could say to you Roger and then be confident you can go ahead.\\n Okay. Alright thanks Craig.\\n Thanks  for calling.\\n Okay to Carine Wayne hello Wayne.\\n Yeah good morning gentlemen.\\n Hi Wayne.\\n Um just a query on what do you think about Carine I just look at the surrounding uh suburbs like Marmian and North Beach seem to be flying ahead um Karrinyup's being rezoned 'n' y'know making lots of money 'n' Carine seems to be like the sleepy little suburb in the middle that's sorta just plodding away plodding away. Um do you see it going up much in the future or s just plugging away as it has been for the last say fifteen years or so.\\n Well Carine tt I dunno why it really has as you say just plugged along  um look at uh Gwelup on the other side of it  um that's really come along with all the new homes that were built there uh and I mean the the price at Gwelup is around three-hundred-'n'-forty-thousand as of March but it's three-seventy as December so Gwelup's nice. Carine's looking around about the four-hundred-thousand sort of median price uh as as of March but uh North Beach and Marmian are more than a hundred-thousand more than that. So Carine by comparison looks like pretty good value to me. I think uh uh y'know it's not bad buying there  um have you got property there already.\\n Yeah I own a property here I've h had it here for about seventeen years but  um y'know it's that it's the wh whether you sell or not 'n' move on y'know if you sell it it's gunna go isn't it  if you don't ih it won't sort of thing.\\n Yeah look the last five years uh Carine's improved by nine-point-six per cent per year so  if you look at that versus all the areas around it it really has underperformed uh I don't know why . Um I don't think that'll stay that way forever myself.\\n No.\\n Uh I I think Carine's got all the all the I wants it's close to everything you wanna be close to and I think that uh you'll probably see in the next three to five years a lot of uh extended building going on there. Now what I mean by that is renovations happening 'n' people adding uh adding rooms to the large blocks that are there . And yeah you'll find that the suburb will start improving so y'know look if unless you can find uh another area that you think'll perform better why would you sell why would you sell 'n' pay any tax 'n' pay all those transfer fees 'n' if you're happy there stick around.\\n Yeah that's right okay then thanks for that mate.\\n Thanks.\\n Good on you thank you bye.\\n See you later Wayne hello Betty of Mullaloo.\\n Hello Craig and Harvey.\\n Hi  Betty.\\n I've just would like your opinion please I've been looking around for three by two by twos. I have sold my home 'n' so I have about three-hundred-'n'-twenty-thousand to spend on an on a three by two by two   I've looked in Innaloo um uh Nollamara Morley all those areas around there and I've been stuck on the best designer and the best unit I can see is in Nollamara South Nollamara   where they're doing lots of new units and new two-storey homes. Is it a good idea I'm going to be putting in an offer in today perhaps to hold the unit for myself. It's not quite finished until October but the builders and the uh owners want between three-twenty-five 'n' three-thirty-five for the it's a duplex arrangement a three by two by two  a lovely design.\\n Is it single-storey Betty.\\n Yeah single-storey.\\n Alright and uh a large home.\\n Yes lounge room and family room in this yi it's a duplex but it's got a lounge room and a family room and love lots of cupboards and a lovely design.\\n Alright now the median price in Nollamara as at March was two-fifty-three uh with a bullet that's really jumping up there  I think there's still room to go. Uh if you look at uh 'n' like Yokine it's three-fifty median price.\\n I can't find  anything that's nice around  three-twenty.\\n See Yokine's nearly a hundred-thousand more and  you're talking about inverted commas South Nollamara I guess that's the that's that's the better part of Nollamara if if you could say that  and that's on the Yokine border so uh by comparison that looks like reasonable value. Um so look I I can't see any any challenge why you shouldn't make that offer if it's within your budget how how how much have you looked around Betty.\\n I have been searching I've been going through these concrete slabs on the ground and  half-walls and asking for them to send me the plans and seeing there's no cupboards and there's y'know things are wrong with all the units.\\n Alright but this one's singing to you.\\n This one's lovely .\\n Theh then this is the one that that's for you  I think.\\n Thank you cr uh  Craig I was  hoping  you would say that.\\n Betty it sounds okay.\\n Good on you.\\n Thank you bye-bye.\\n It's seven minutes to eight uh good morning now.\\n\\n\\n Running outta time Craig four minutes to eight o'clock time though to talk to Laurie at Cooloongup g'day Laurie.\\n Yeah good morning.\\n Morning Laurie.\\n Juh uh wanna get a bit of an idea of what the property around um Cooloongup or East Waikiki or something like that they call it   uh four by one double garage plenty of parking rumpus room all that just get a bit of an idea.\\n Okay very hard for me to give you an exact number without seeing your home um  I can tell you that the the Cooloongup median price that's the middle range price which you'd think'd be like a three by one uh was a hundred-'n'-eighty-thousand as at uh the end of March and in uh Waikiki it was two-hundred-'n'-fifteen-thousand now that's uh you'd think that'd be a three by one so if it's a four by one and it's a great place and it's in good condition Laurie you'd certainly be over two-hundred-thousand but how much I don't know. Um have you had uh any local real estate agents give you an appraisal yet.\\n Ah y get plenty of informuh plenty of pamphlets in the letterbox.\\n Yeah stacks of 'em . Look it wouldn't hurt to invite one or two of the the I guess the more well-known ones to come 'n' give you a written appraisal. Are you actually thinking of selling or just trying to figure out what it's worth.\\n Ah just get a bit of an idea I'm at a bit of a dilemma at the moment um uh so I just have to uh hang fire  but  there's no harm in getting some info.\\n Yeah looh I I'm guessing and I really I'm not sure without y'know get a local specialist in there but uh but probably at least two-hundred maybe two-twenty-thousand somewhere in that range but uh g get some local help Laurie uh 'n' that that's your best bet.\\n Thanks Laurie quickly Gail uh just uh purchased a second investment home six months old unfinished. They've borrowed the full amount plus enough to add a patio. \\n That's a good question there's so many m mixes 'n' matches with that one.\\n Well why don't I print this out and uh you can have a look at it during the week 'cos it is an all day question isn't it.\\n Yeah it it uh f I need to understand what happened there I don't know whether they're living in it or not living in it um ih if you're living in it doesn't make any difference because you can't claim any depreciation benefits. Um look print that one out Harv 'n'  'n' I'll take that one under advisement.\\n Okay now just before we go wanted to talk to you about an article wuh was it Wednesday's paper about  big redevelopment at the old Swan brewery site.\\n Harvey Perth is growing up um wuh there's a a proposal for two like sixty-storey towers that they'll be two tallest buildings in Perth uh with about a thousand apartments in total  being built on this on this site that's been empty for like the last twenty or thirty years I th I think pretty much. Uh and uh finally a developer has got approvals from all the relative bodies to build these two amazing big towers and I think that's gunna be a watershed for for the city and um I hope that um they get plenty of buyers and uh uh people decide that um that's a good thing to be in uh myself I'm not sure about it but uh.\\n What do you reckon they'll sell for  pretty hard to tell now isn't it.\\n Look I'd be surprised if they start out at under three-hundred-thousand  and probably y'know upwards of y'know million plus for the for the top-storey apartments probably even even more than that for the  for the penthouses uh y'know I haven't seen the configuration yet so.\\n Thousand apartments.\\n Uh yeah that's huge  that that's a lot of volume I dunno how they're gunna do it but good luck to them.\\n Alright well we'll watch that one with a great deal of interest. Mate thanks to everyone who called us today had a lotta calls  and uh sorry if you tried to get through 'n' you couldn't quite manage it but uh try again next week that's when we'll be back with Real Estate between seven and eight you have a lovely week Craig and I will talk to you at seven o'clock next Saturday morning.\\n Thanks very much and luh look looking forward to it.\\n\",\n          \" Freo Dockers skipper there Peter Bell hello everyone and welcome to Sports Today for Panasonic Ducted Air Conditioning and Craft Decor Adrian Anderson to join us from the A F L general manager of football operations tonight in his usual fortnightly segment and we were talking waffle for A H T with Harvey Deegan and the motor racing segment for Barbagallo Raceway with Andrew Van Leeuwen you can join us at any time nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two on the phone. Or if you'd like to email Barry checks it at every ad break. Sport at Six P R dot com dot A U as I ent I uh intuh introduced the said person hello Mr Barich how are you.\\n Hey Barney how are you mate yeah.\\n Jeez time goes fast doesn't it Belly playing his hundredth game for the Dockers.\\n Yeah that's right uh.\\n Doesn't seem like he's been back here that long does it  but it goes quick.\\n Was it one game in nineteen-ninety-five.\\n Long time ago.\\n Yeah wuh was it ninety-five . Two games two games .\\n Yeah one half and then another half.\\n That's right and then  uh ninety-eight games when they had to pay a fortune to get him back . Hey tell me about uh Belly 'cos uh was interesting today  at the press conference uh uh the media quizzed him about y'know Connolly's uh decih decision not to let him play in the middle him 'n' c y'know uh Carr and uh Hasleby   and he let Gilmore go in there 'n' Dylan Smith 'n' how did you feel about it 'n' he refused to comment. Wouldn't talk about it just uh kept batting it away saying nah it's up to the coach uh it's coaching staff decision uh not gunna comment one way or the other whether I thought it was a good move or a bad move or how I felt about it uh   yeah I just thought that was thought that was pretty interesting uh.\\n Well anything he's gunna offer's gunna be twisted so it doesn't matter.\\n Yeah well maybe he took that view. Tell me about uh the.\\n Like your mob did tonight I saw that.\\n What'd they do.\\n Did you oh you wouldn'ta had it over there because Terry Wallace talking to the did you is Seven running the story about   Terry Wallace ing bucketing the uh Telstra Dome surface.\\n Oh yes yeah I got that on the list for Adrian Anderson.\\n Well I well uh   I gotta say I gotta say I I saw him on Ten. Y'know 'n' and and no disrespect Barry to you and your friends at Channel Seven but on Ten he was concerned about yeah the Telstra Dome surface said it was a bit slippery but he was more concerned about his mid the centre four they can't get their hands on the ball and get it out of the middle that was a real problem for him. So what Channel Seven have done   y'know Wallace buckets Telstra Dome and they play the comment about the four players that he's got in the middle that he's he's ih that ih that they're hopeless at the moh it's not it's it's it's diabolical. That  'n' they played it on the back end of that uh  this is what the Telstra Dome is so you're not bad.\\n That's Melbourne was it.\\n Ah  yes it was.\\n It musta been implied or something was it.\\n Ah  you're good.\\n Hey I'm not trying to dodh.\\n You're good your blokes over here.\\n I'm not tr I'm not trying to dodge the subject but uh.\\n Yes you are you're going completely on a different path what're you talking about.\\n Just going back to Peter Bell for a second . Hey mate I wuh there was a discussion at a function I was at uh the other day about uh.\\n Another one.\\n A-grade players and uh how many A-grade players Fremantle actually have and uh the consensus was they only have one. Would you agree with that I mean the people sh.\\n Hmm certainly Pavlich's name comes to mind does it.\\n Yeah Pavlich and that was it uh that uh perhaps Bell doesn't really enter into that category.\\n Nah well if you if you wanna go into that d down that path I mean it's a very subjuctih shubjictive  question isn't it I mean you who who knows.\\n Nah but the the bloke who was saying it was saying in the context of look don't be too hard on Fremantle have a look at Hawthorn they've got four  A-grade players y'know  they got Everitt Crawford they chucked he chucked Williams in there and Hodge which is debatable whether they got two or four but uh Fremantle  only has one.\\n Where we're going down this little tangent is that we're ducking away that that Fremantle don't have the real talent.\\n Mm y well that's what the case is being made yeah exactly.\\n Oh okay okay uh uh yuh uh as another excuse or is that a reason.\\n Well I dunno depeh  depends who's saying it . Oh uh oh I deh eh I researched something have we got that audio there too uh Rob of uh this is ang just before I tell you about this uh.\\n You love the audio.\\n Tt I do I love audio 'cos y'know it's a it's an audio medium and.\\n Saves you from speaking.\\n It's right and uh it's it's m it's muhc encapsulated better by people  like Peter Bell talking about Polak and Dodd's suspension here's what he had to say first of all.\\n\\n\\n Now the news out of Fremantle tonight was that uh Connolly spoke to th each player individually just about on the ground at training tonight uh there's no chance McPharlin or c Matt Carr will play they're miles away uh  and possibly Headland and I asked about the whole Polak situation and uh that basically the bottom line was they wanted to keep an eye on him. That's why they took him over they wanted to keep an eye on him because perhaps who knows what he'd get up to over here which is   y'know not a great thing to say I suppose.\\n Ah you're kidding aren't you.\\n But uh the other thing I found out is uh they all went and saw the Lion King too the all the boys 'n' the girl  girlfriends and wives and that too so . D'you reckon that'd fire them up.\\n Ah yeah well it's fired me up.\\n Dih d'you see the Lion King.\\n Ah well tt no I haven't seen the Lion King.\\n That'd be the singing and dancing.\\n That's the one on stage.\\n Yeah the stage.\\n Yeah it's.\\n What would that be like.\\n Oh well if you like stage shows it'd be fantastic I'm sure.\\n Yeah ih be ah be able to draw something outta that is it Simba was that Simba or.\\n.\\n Simba in that one.\\n I prefer le Moulin Rouge.\\n Is that why .\\n I saw that in Las Vegas when I was there that was alright.\\n What's the name of the lion in the uh Lion King it's not Simba is it that's  the White Lion. It was something else uh.\\n Big Cat.\\n No no no he's got 'n' the bad guy what's his name Tooth or Fang or something anyway we'll get we'll sort  it out. If you know uh wuh who's in the Lion King  give us a call  we've got footy tickets to give away too Barney again.\\n Yes that's great thanks to Carlton Midstrength's fifth quarter helping you to stay a little longer this football season the Dockers's supporters were certainly leaving a couple of weeks ago.\\n Yes it did leave a bit early 'n' there's been feedback about . No people were saying that the reason like there was a bit of a uh a a poll on t one of the websites 'n' it the l most of people's reasoning was they were sending a message to the club . It was a good way to send a message by leaving early.\\n Thank God for that I thought they must've run out of Carlton Midstrength.\\n Yeah well that's right anyway we've got tickets to that elimination final virtual elimination final uh the Kangaroos versus the Dockers and uh and what about the cricket mate the empire struck  back. You told me.\\n Ah well twen Twenty Twenty cricket is a absolute garbage mate at the international  level. And you know that I know that I think the punters know that I think it's got a its place in domestic cricket here in Australia I think it's not a bad idea I think it went very well didn't it down at the WACA. That night when we had it down there when the W A boys played the Bush Rangers. I think that went fantastic but at international level surely it's not right it is just not right.\\n Uh well I know it's I know it's just hit and giggle but there were some  you gotta say there were some good signs there for the Poms. I mean  now what about their  their fielding even their fielding.\\n They got McGilly out and they got Hayden out 'cos they went for the tonk.\\n No but their fielding was actually uh had  gone up a level. And Darren.\\n Yeah wuh th w yeah wuh that's that bloke look like a skunk what's his name.\\n Oh c is it Collingwood  Bob . Yeah it's Collingwood isn't it.\\n No Pietersen isn't it.\\n No Pietersen yeah Pietersen's .\\n H hasn't he got the m he  he's got the mullet like a skunk.\\n Yeah he's the South African gun he was the bloke who went to the hairdresser's with Warnie. 'Cos they're mates in Hampshire d'you hear about that. 'N' they went to the hairdresser to have a cut and the hairdresser said hey Warnie you're going you're thinning out back here. And that's now Advanced Hair Yeah Yeah . Jeez  mate how good is Warnie . He's turned all his flaws into money . He's tuh he quit smoking for two-hundred grand  well didn't quit smoking but he said he'd quit . And uh now he's done the hair bit how much would he have got for that.\\n Six figure sum.\\n Oh it's just magnificent  isn't it and weight loss . Wait till Viagra kicks in down the track  when he's a bit older  he'll make a foll poultice outta that. Anyway you can't uh y'know he's a bit vain but you can't uh blame him I suppose we're all a  a bit that way. But anyway back to the cricket mate I Boof Lehmann great commentated first first up debut thought he was terrific  he's gunna be doing stuff on this station . Did you hear na.\\n And Both.\\n N n Both as well. Naf Nasser Hussain  and David Lloyd they've just fired up they ripped into the Aussies. Ih n Nasser Hussain at one stage said put your pads on McGrath you'll need them. Y'know like uh they're getting pretty cocky they're getting  pretty cocky  got a lotta emails and phone messages today.\\n Absolutely nothing to d derive outta that I didn't think. Not a thing.\\n What about uh the performance. The lion king is Mufasa . And  his son is Simba so yeah so I didn't say Simba though did I. Did I say Simba.\\n I thought you said Kimba the White Lion  thinking about you've been watching too many cartoons.\\n That was the cartoon Mufasa  we've had about three million calls thank you  we know it's Mufasa now and the bad guy was Fang I think . But if so you can't take I would like to hear from our listeners can we take anything outta that Twenty Twenty game cah should the Aussies  be a little bit concerned.\\n Absolutely  zero.\\n Nothing  nothing.\\n You see some of the shots we played.\\n It's got.\\n They didn't wanna be there mate.\\n Like seven for eight or something they got.\\n They didn't wanna be there. And why would ya. I mean because look they used to have this real concern about uh guys playing in test match cricket the purists said well there are guys who play test match cricket who can't play one day cricket 'cos it affects their technique . Well what is Twenty Twenty cricket gunna do to your technique. I mean  the only one who's really suited to it is Gilly  because.\\n Matt 'n' siv Simons.\\n Ah yeah to a degree but yuh but Gilly plays with a long handle most of the time so it doesn't worry him. Hayden has had an absolute Barry Crocker over the past year or so and he's still playing same rash pool shots which ch gets the top edge and go about thirty-five-million miles in the air  and he gets caught forward of uh square leg y'know I mean ih th  it is not good for Matthew Hayden and it's not good for a lot of  other players. Y'know and when Jason Gillespie who is arguably one of the premier bowlers in the world  bowls four overs for forty-nine runs  what does that say about .\\n I'll give you the tip Lee is definitely not suited to Twenty Twenty Lee  there's no doubt about it but uh well come on th I wanna be convinced by the listeners I mean do you think there's nothing to be taken outta that or is it is there a chance that the Poms are  up and running and that  they maybe they will challenge the Aussies.\\n It should be restricted to the domestic competition here in Australia nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two if you'd like to put yourself in the running for those two tickets to Fremantle versus the Kangaroos on the weekend which we're dubbing the elimination final and you heard Belly he's sorta s concerned that uh he'd like to be winning a few more games and well it'd be a good game to get along to Peter Bell what of a great servant he's been for Fremantle his hundredth game coming up on the weekend for the club 'n' you got an opportunity go along by putting yourself in the running. Let's go to the phones hello Adrian at Duncraig\\n Oh g'day guys how are you mate.\\n Good.\\n Hey look I'm an avid cricket follower and I actually stayed up to watch that game last night  and still managed to get to work this morning  and just a couple of points hurm uh   when they started 'n' they won the toss um the rr um uh who was it the captain of the English side y'know said that he was going in for a real dig  Rickie Ponting actually said y'know I hope people take it that it's a bit of fun and everything like that  and dead set it's two different approaches now if anyone says that that Australian side is gunna be absolutely um  um a bit uh threatened or tentative by that game last night they're they're they're a they're a joke. Now if you look.\\n Hey you make  you do make a lotta sense is there anything we can take out of it though is there e like y'know maybe the Poms have improved in the field or  perhaps they will be a bit more competitive .\\n The Poms have improved in the field I'll give 'em that from watching that game and I said I I watch a lotta cricket um they've improved in the field immensely right but the thing is you've gotta look at your bowlers right now those English bowlers I mean Darren Gough took three  he's not even playing for 'em mate  you've gotta you gotta sustain that.\\n What about Jon Lewis who does midnight to dawn he uh he was brih  he was brilliant.\\n But if you had a look at the balls that the Australians got out to right  it was just ih ih it wasn't I mean Glenn McGrath bowls more balls on line than the whole English team did right  it was just one of those games and dead set the Australians uh the the way they got out it was just like they didn't have an interest because Australia sets itself for the big games and for the Ashes and I'll tell you now England will not win a test they might win a few one-dayers but they will not win a test.\\n Good on you  good on you Adrian appreciate you  starting us off to Parkwood hello Peter   oh.\\n Peter of Parkwood.\\n Hello Peter.\\n Poyter .\\n Mightta lost him. We'll go back to Peter see we can get him in a minute let's go down to Steve at Applecross.\\n Yeah hi guys uh great show um just briefly on that Twenty Twenty game I think if it's a confidence game that's uh or confidence that's kept England down for these years  they'd have to take a little bit from it surely  I mean I know it's only Twenty Twenty it's all good fun everyone's stats go to hell but  yeah they get blown to blazes but I think um.\\n It just meh it made the Aussies look human a bit Steve didn't it uh and theh  not like these unbeatable moh monsters that come over and just monster you.\\n Yeah well especially after that um was it the county game or the first game where Lee took a wicket off the first ball I mean some people must've been thinking same old same old again . And they um their star South African got went for five or something but I mean uh yeah I think this has brought it back to an even keel 'n' I think we're we're back wandering again I think now it's um who knows.\\n What about that ball that uh who's the opener Jones hit back  over Lee's head nearly killed him.\\n Yeah  well he's  no fast bowler like that do they but  I mean  he might but Brett might remember that one for later I think though.\\n Yeah  exactly.\\n Good on you Steve  thanks for your thoughts mate we appreciate it to Quinns Rocks hello Tom.\\n G'day how you going.\\n Good.\\n Hello.\\n Yes Tom  fire away my friend.\\n Yeah um just ringing to say that I agree with you about the Twenty Twenty I mean I think it's purely set up to make the batsman look good it completely kills the bowler's averages  and just just complete waste of time.\\n They may as well not have bowlers I reckon they should just get one of those uh bowling machines up there and just hurl  'em down.\\n Yeah just like that they have in baseball or something yeah just give the batsman a bit of practice I mean  that's all it seems to be.\\n Well uh the the more tripe you bowl the more likely you are to get a wicket there you are. And and blokes who bowl line and length like McGrath and Gillespie and that and and even Lee I mean he y'know he bowls quick but jeez it just plays into your hands Barry you only have to get a nick and  see you later notice.\\n Thah yuh thah.\\n It still tah  a couple of hours   couple of overs to get going though doesn't it.\\n Yeah it's a.\\n That would explain John Lewis getting wickets I gotta  say 'cos how  bad was he he's just bolh tossing 'em up.\\n To Roleystone g'day Ben.\\n How you going Brad  a while ago I read somewhere on and heard you say that football was now boring let's have Twenty Twenty footy and let's see how better it is.\\n Mm Twenty Twenty footy.\\n Yeah  Twenty Twenty  footy y'know.\\n How would you do that Ben.\\n Easily.\\n Yeah tell us how.\\n Well   you get uh you got your twenty minutes.\\n Mm.\\n Uh the um everybody stays on the on the equator side or across the central line  and then you're into it just chuck the ball up in the air and away you go for  twenty minutes just slug it out.\\n Like British British bulldog  at school or something.\\n Yeah something like that a bit.\\n Come on over.\\n Yeah there's no  the day of tradition and uh truism and uh the the the skills of the game are fastly going and uh this Twenty Twenty cricket is a typical example of let's have a good time and don't worry about uh anything . Twenty Twenty football's  the coming thing.\\n Made for T V Ben.\\n Yeah.\\n Good on you mate thanks very much mate um and and look what I said about boring about the footy was I was gr I was trying to um well not justify what Sam Newman had to say Barra 'cos y we know he got benched over here but he he did have a point and I mean anybody who watched the Hawthorn St Kilda game on the weekend could not have thought anything else than that that it was the worst game of football that you've ever seen because unfortunately some of the players are that robotic at the moment  they are that terrified they're gunna make a mistake they are that scrutinised that they think they're gunna get a clanger next to their name they are that frightened to kick the ball to a contest ih it's becoming by and large very embarrassing particularly from Hawthorn's point of view 'cos  y'know Maguire slipped down the field on uh on the weekend three times because he didn't have an opponent 'cos Hawthorn had that many behind the ball it wasn't funny so even when they won it they had a succession of possessions and that's why Crawford tt 'n' Mitchell 'n' ih Smith and all of these guys racked up y'know thirty-plus possessions and when they went to kick the ball down the ground there was young Mark Williams and four St Kilda defenders . And guess what happened . The poor kid got slaughtered. You know and the ball came back down the other end Fraser Gehrig was fantastic missed a few but y'know they just whipped the ball into their forward line and kicked to score. Now   if that's good footy uh I'm not here buh so so I understand 'cos I know Ben's a real grassroots man 'n' 'n' so am I but I just wanted to make that point that I think Sam Newman had a bit of a point  because it not only about Hawthorn there have been other games and.\\n Wuh d what did you make of the um Geelong Adelaide game then d'you you know Adelaide had a hundred-and-eighty-seven handballs. Some sort of A F L  record it's sih like sixty more handballs than a than you would have in a normal game and uh yeah I mean it was c exciting at the end there but gee Matty Scarlett was sensational but gee  that's a lotta hanh it was like rugby wasn't it  more ha more handballs than kicks.\\n Oh yeah it was crazy. Nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two we'll take your calls if you wanna go and see Belly's one hundredth game for the Freo Dockers on Sunday they play the Kangaroos be the best talkback caller tonight nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two Adrian Anderson'll join us after the break here on Sports Today.\\n\\n\\n Yes didn't Nasser Hussain love that Barra and uh huh  he hah  not bad for a captain who's got a record of four from about fifty-six  um.\\n Get your  get your pads on  Glen McGrath.\\n And as we go to.\\n Go 'n' get nicked Nasser Hus .\\n Least he's won something  uh to Glendalough hello Andrew.\\n What about the 'n' um Pommy commentator who said smashing smashing .\\n Yeah he was he wuh  he was barracking.\\n I luh I listened to the radio after that. I couldn't handle that anymore.\\n What'd how'd they finish that's uh end of story start the car . Oh give us a break.\\n Who was that commentator guys.\\n David.\\n I think I think it might've been the same bloke who broadcast the Kostya Tszyu Ricky Hatton fight.\\n Oh he was a moron  anyway.\\n Dave it was David ih.\\n Why has it got boundary ropes.\\n Well I woulda sworn that theh wuh when the the day that Tszyu fought there was only one bloke in the ring.\\n David  David Lloyd  was the uh David Lloyd was the bloke with Boof I'm surprised Boof didn't shin him and uh  Nasser Hussain was down  on the boundary talking absolute Swahili I'll tell ya .\\n When the real stuff comes on and they beat us in a test I'll be uh tip my hat to 'em but this Twenty Twenty is just a lot b like winning the raffle innit.\\n Yeah  I suppose.\\n Exactly.\\n But  they did loo they did look better.\\n Why has it got boundary ropes in the grounds at England aren't they small enough without boundary ropes.\\n Mm. That's.\\n Like y'know you 'n' me could just about top one over the top.\\n I think you're right  they were saying it was gunna go rows back 'n' it went about three rows back 'n' theh and it was the the the boundary line was less than fifty metres from the centre of the wicket I reckon .\\n And so how're Bangladesh gunna go against uh Australia 'n' England at Twenty Twenty cricket.\\n Well that's what they suh that's what they said . They said if England can beat Bangladesh they're genuine contenders .\\n Someone's rang through mate and said the the Kostya bloke was Ian Darke is it Darke and uh David Lloyd was the one last night said that   a man who coached an England side that was pumped three-one by Australia in nineteen-eighty-nine ninety-nine series.\\n Yeah I think Ian Darke was one of 'em but there was another bloke who just never shut up through the Kostya Tszyu fight 'n' every time that uh Kostya landed a punch he forget to say that he did. Tt .\\n Hey mate just on that just  before we move off boxing moight .\\n Boxing moight .\\n Moight  what's going on moight  uh last week we spurkt spoke to Fenech 'n' he w had a bit of a crack at Kostya for  uh not coming out in the last round . And then Tyson doesn't come out.\\n Yes we got Jeff Fenech on Thursday night spoke to him today and he was quite buoyant and he says and I'll let him tell the story because   uh it's a great one. It's a very interesting story so  stay listening on Thursday  night  because we're gunna have Jeff Fenech and Mahatma Coat.\\n Oh jeez that's a big night.\\n So the big double.\\n And what abh and there's a story theh bumping around uh over the weekend about Jeff threatening to perhaps uh take legal action against Danny Green. D'ya see  that . Train yeah suh  something along the lines of uh he may still technically be his manager and uh he uh proceeds may need to be coming to him still that uh huh he hasn't received or something 'n'  then he says he might train Mundine as well.\\n Not a chance in the world anyway we will um we'll try and uh let you know but uh let me tell you this he will not be training Anthony Mundine.\\n What about a legal stoush with D Green.\\n Mm I dunno Paul asked Jeff on  we'll know  with Jeff on well listen on Thursday night 'n'.\\n  Alright well whe what about  Tyson's fight mate what'd you think about that.\\n I didn't see the fight I was in the I was at the footy match in Sydney.\\n I was texting  you every  every round.\\n Yeah you texted me after the after I'd had the result from fifteen different people.\\n Oh sorry I was the  only one who told you it was a T K O in the at the end of the sixth 'n'  it didn't come out 'n'.\\n Daniel had already informed me as a matter of fact what happened.\\n He doesn't know about boxing.\\n To Wanneroo hello Wayne.\\n G'day Brad how are you.\\n Good mate.\\n Mate I'm I'm ringing up about is um I'm the footy manager at Wanneroo Kingsway Footy Club.\\n Yep.\\n And we've got one of our young boys playing with you tomorrow night over in the uh Legends game.\\n Really did he win it on the um tt on the Ray White  thing.\\n Yeah yeah.\\n Oh good on him. What's his name.\\n Uh Ben Cuming.\\n Ben.\\n Ben Cuming  C U M I N G.\\n Oh okay.\\n He's  he stands five foot nothing mate 'n' uh he's as skinny as a rake but   he's a he's a real little goer so he'll he'll have a good tip when he gets on.\\n Oh good is he playing uh which team is he playing for do you know.\\n Uh  he's playing for the All Stars.\\n Ah good he's on our side that'll be great.\\n Yeah .\\n Well I'll uh I'll say g'day to the young man and uh wish him well we'll look out for him mate.\\n Yeah I I believe he's the well I would think he'd be the first bloke from uh community footy in W A  isn't he  who's certainly played in that game so.\\n Yeah well ih when they ran that national wide uh Wayne to  try 'n' y'know you just should uh to click on the W W W dot Ray White I think it was uh and uh suggest why you should be playing.\\n Hey Wayne just have a word.\\n They might play him on they might play him on Libba.\\n Well matey he warmed up on Sunday with seven goals so.\\n Yeah  did he.\\n Yeah.\\n Well mate t t tell him what to do if he wants to be famous and uh y'know a hero in Western Australia tell him to either run through Libba or Dermot alright  one of those two just ping one of those and uh we'll we'll uh y'know he when he comes back we'll all be at the airport to uh cheer him on.\\n Yeah I tell you what if they get in his way he'll run through 'em .\\n Will he . Ah beautiful .\\n Good on you how old is he uh Wayne.\\n He's nineteen.\\n Nineteen good on him well  I'll look well I'll say g'day to the young man tomorrow  Ben Ben Cuming.\\n You never muh  you never move Barney from beside the goal post.\\n Nah we I'll see him in the change rooms  before we go . That's what I'm saying  before we go  good on you Wayne and thanks for letting us know so whe where where was he from Wanneroo was it.\\n Yeah Wanneroo.\\n Wanneroo. Up there at uh whatta they call.\\n Kings Kingway  was a huge huge area.\\n To Ferndale hello Andy.\\n Oh hi Brad. Er good luck uh good luck tomorrow night.\\n I I'm gunna need it.\\n H hope you get a kick .\\n Yeah. I hope I get on.\\n Hope you  get a respirator.\\n No you'll get on. Yeah wuh one of those famous runs down the wing.\\n Who's  coaching who's coaching you Barney.\\n Uh Graham Cornes he takes it a bit serious . S needs a good short sharpy  under the chin to.\\n He's a strange fella.\\n And a beat a ih  the only thing is if you knock Cornesy out Andy.\\n Yeah.\\n Knuckles Kerley takes over and he's worse .\\n What's the go with all the South Australians . S need Mal isn't Mal Brown around.\\n He's still bluing from all those years ago when Victoria used to wallop him. I'm sure of it. So and what would you wanna say Andy anyway.\\n Uh yeah I just wanted to wish you bit of luck I'd and I'd and the Dockers'll murder those mongrels on suh Sunday.\\n The Roos.\\n Yeah the Roos  yeah and uh the um the umpires when it trickled   little bit of rain the other night  done a great job at the Eagles game . The mongrels won .\\n Good on you Andy  stay listening mate you might be in the crowd on the weekend.\\n What about them wearing the red uniforms too. Is it it was reddish 'n' they wuh uh th they were playing the bombers I mean   fair dinkum y'know yeah v apparently every Monday morning the first item on the heavy hitters' meeting at the A F L house or whatever it's called is what colour should the umpires' uniforms be this week depending on the games . I mean it's big stuff innit y'know. What colour should we have this week oh  orange or yellow.\\n Well I think they should be  a little bit different to whatever the colours are of the teams that are out on the ground I think that'd help I mean 'cos  sometimes there is a clash. To Willetton hello Val.\\n Yeah how youse going.\\n We missed you last night what happened to you we tried you about three times I reckon.\\n Sorry I've  bumped a a a.\\n The phone outta the wall.\\n Yeah okay  um I'd just like to talk about  um the Dockers.\\n Mm.\\n And um Johnson.\\n Michael Johnson.\\n He was on Hall.\\n He was.\\n And he did an absolutely fantastic job 'n' I haven't heard much about it on the radio.\\n Well we did on Sunday we we gave him a bit of rap we said that the boy was a little unlucky on a couple of occasions and Barry kicked uh a few goals on him but  there were a couple of times there he was caught outta position not not following any s yih too far but it was just enough to 'cos Barry was a little bit more seasoned a little bit more experienced 'n' judged the flight better.\\n Well more mature isn't it  I mean that age man uh um compared to Michael I think is outstanding  with Michael.\\n 'N' y'know what Val  he is gunna learn so much from that. I was talking to Sheeds during the week 'n' he was saying that remember when uh Gary Ablett kicked fourteen goals one day.\\n Mhm.\\n Mm.\\n Guess who played on him for most of the day .\\n James Hird.\\n James Hird and  uh y'know they you just learn so much from that just watching  'em but. 'N' he'll be a g he'll be a better player for it 'n' he'll be a good player for the club no doubt about it.\\n Oh I know and the other thing is   that the good players in the Dockers   everybody's bag m most people are bagging them but when um any of the top players get the ball there's three four or five opposition players around the crumbs  'n' the same with Jeff Farmer and um  Brisbane Brisbane coach said that um all they had to do was contain Jeff  and  he had about five players on him all the time and there was no way he could get the ball and kick a goal.\\n Yeah I dunno about  I dunno about Jeff Val as much as Pavlich definitely got double teamed 'n' 'triple teamed 'n'. Got an email here from Frank uh down in Fremantle Barney and uh he saw Kevin Sheedy today with his wife   down at on the cafe strip or the cappuccino strip ih at Gino's is it Gino's. Gino's  isn't it  yeah having a  coffee down there no sight of uh anyone else that he was meeting or anything like that if you wanna start any rumours but uh  there's no no he's just having enjoying uh Western Australia Sheeds obviously loves it over here.\\n Good on him. Good stuff to Yangebup hello Rob.\\n Uh yeah how you going Brad 'n' Barra.\\n We're good.\\n Hey uh   I'm a uh Dockers member  uh fortunately me mate bought me a uh membership and uh I've been to the going to the games like um start of the year . But uh I won't be going to the football next uh week because um unless they pull their ringholes out and uh get their act together   um I don't wanna watch 'em 'cos they're that frustrating  and um I was just wondering who's the recruitment um team down there like they just seem to recruit a lot of um WAFL players. 'N' I know the Eagles recruit WAFL players as well but they seem to get a few good players from over east d'y'know what I mean . And um also I was just wondering how uh me mate D Oliver's going Brad if you've uh spoken to him lately.\\n Yeah no he was uh ma I spoh I did speak to him about uh ten days ago no he was uh going along nicely and he's enjoying a fair bit of the footy at the moment they're in a good year for him to be following the West Coast too Rob to be quite honest because they keep notching up wins no he he is going well but uh as we say he's got a bit of a decision to make at a little bit further down the track whether he tries to ride with the rods in his back that he's got there at the moment titanium rods or he has an operation to take them out so I've got a funny feeling that he might like to um take them out 'n' spend the extra time on the sidelines 'n' come back 'n' make sure he's a million per cent but good on you Rob I'm sure he um enjoys and yours and everybody else who listens to eight-eighty-two six P R's interest in him. Nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is our open line number Adrian Anderson'll be ready after the break here on Sports Today.\\n\\n\\n Sports Today with Brad 'n' Barra for Panasonic Ducted Air Conditioning and Craft Decor g'day guys to buh both establishments great sponsors of Sports Today to Ferndale g'day Pete.\\n How you going Brad how you going Barra.\\n Good mate .\\n Uh just to um that guy who was saying he's never gunna go and watch the Hickory Dickories again . Come on mate show some loyalty eh  you wanna be a Magpie you gotta  stay with 'em y'know.\\n Yeah I know  I agree with yih you 'n' agre.\\n It's like saying  Barich leave Perth . Y'know what I mean.\\n Yeah . No we  agree with you Pete 'n' I think we've always maintained we've been uh we've been critiques of er of Fremantle there's no doubt about that but uh I've always maintained have we not Barra that y'know if you expect the boys to fight on the field you should be f ready to fight on the terraces as  slang that is to support them that's all.\\n Where do you stand with uh leaving early.\\n Oh they can do what they like I don't mind  it's up to people's ch it's peetshuh that's a person's choice if they choose to leave because they're not happy with what they're seeing that's fine 'n' if they wanna stay till the end well that's fine too.\\n Do you think it's a good statement to make though to stay to the bitter end and.\\n It's not a statement. I mean ih rea I mean.\\n You don't think it's a statement .\\n No I don't  oh unfortunately  not I mean   people read too much into their own actions . To be quite honest. I mean do you reckon the players look  over the fence and say naw people are leaving.\\n But it is pretty embarrassing when you the the stah stadium empties out at three quarter time when you y'know when you're playing 'n' you look 'n' you see people streaming out 'n' you think phew yeah.\\n But it's it's it's not high on their priority list Barra that's what I'm saying I mean I'm not saying it's y'know that the people y'know er if they feel as though it's a statement well they they probably think they are but there there are probably better ways to go about it I would suggest but anyway weh that's that's their choice as we say 'n' ih people pay their money they're entitled to leave 'n' go 'n' come when they want to. To Gosnells hello Karen.\\n Oh yeah hi guys yeah that's the trouble isn't it too much money um no I'd suggest to that guy that yeah he's not a very good supporter because when the chips are down and things aren't going too well and the Eagles are doing so well um yeah it's all very well for some people to say oh I'm not gunna go along and support but that's when we really do need the suppor  supporters to come along  and just a typical example was that last week my son um went into a service station and all the there was a big promotional thing about Eagles obviously and him being a real fanatical supporter um when he saw that they were all wearing Eagles T-shirts and all this kind of thing he said what's going on um and he they just said y'know oh yeah Eagles blah blah blah and he said well can't you see I'm a Dockers supporter and showed the keyring and his car with all the stickers and because it was like pay before you go it was late at night  he just walked out of the store and went somewhere else . So y'know there's different ways of supporting your club  and um y'know show your colours guys and uh .\\n Karen  we've gotta get a that bit of that tribalism back in 'em Karen that's what we've gotta do.\\n Yeah it's all  territorial isn't it.\\n Yes it is.\\n What about leaving what about leaving early though there's this debate whether ih if ye if you wanna make a statement uh yih yih ih 'n' say to the club look we're not happy or the players or whoever the coach whatever  leaving early's the way to do it what do you think.\\n No I don't think I would never leave early 'cos you pay good money to go there  and not only that like I said ih wuh y'know if the score's y'know one point to twenty goals well that that's when your team needs you the most because like I said no-one likes getting beaten 'n' especially thrashed by lots  but I dunno it's just y'know if you're a fan you're a fan 'n' it luh y'know like I said when when you do win it becomes all the more sweet eh ih if you don't win so much  and y'know people winning all the time well y'know good luck to the Eagles they're  doing well  but y'know it'll be sweet when we do win.\\n Oh I agree Karen 'n' I I I just think I just keep urging the Fremantle supporters to keep going along I I think Barry you'd get a better t a worse taste in your mouth if you were a player. You would probably recognise it when you come out first on the ground 'n' if there was no people in the stands then then you might be thinking  hello what's  going on here. But uh  for 'em to leave  midway through a game uh uh or y'know third quarter or whatever I think that's everybody's prerogative.\\n The worst taste in the in my mouth I got was uh when I got spat on at the M C G  who wants to go over there.\\n Who was it.\\n Uh oh yeah good on you no  it was the fans mate 'n' they those Collingwood fans they just 'n' I wasn't .\\n Tell tell your family to stay at home Barra when  you're playing will you.\\n Yeah um exactly leave me alone.\\n Adrian Anderson joins us and he sees a fair bit of the uh grassroots footy 'cos he's still playing himself he's the A F L general manager of football operations hello Ade.\\n How you going Brad Barra.\\n Mm things are alright whadda your wuh wuh what's your stance on people whether they wanna leave at midway through the third quarter if they're not happy with their side.\\n Oh look y'know I think it's better to stay there to the end but sometimes y'know like if uh I I remember going out to Waverley Park as a kid with the old man 'n' if you got caught in the uh traffic after  the final siren it was about three and a half hours to get out . So uh if it looked like uh it was wuh one-way traffic uh often uh we'd get dragged back out into the car park kicking and screaming at about three quarter time 'n' in retrospect I can understand why.\\n Nice 'n' cold out there . You would've been there in uh were you there in nineteen-ninety-one preliminary final.\\n Yes.\\n E Eagles V Geelong  and the coldest day in the history of the world  wasn't it .\\n It gets cold out there it used  to be about ten degrees colder than anywhere else in Victoria I think.\\n But it's supposedly it's in the rain belt isn't it Adrian  don't they say or something.\\n That's right.\\n Yeah it was  a brilliant idea to build at Collingwood.\\n Mind you I c I was over in Perth on the weekend 'n' I tell you what I was uh  driving along down uh Caves Road ih ih uh at at on um  bay.\\n Oh just down just down Margaret River were you.\\n Yeah it was about twelve o'clock and uh looked at the temperature there it was huh it was sleeting it was five-point-five degrees 'n' I thought take me back to Melbourne.\\n Just  checking on grassroots footy were you or.\\n No we uh  came uhl across for the game on the Friday night.\\n Yes.\\n And um and then uh huh had a chance to uh to slip down south there for a for a day or so with the uh with the girlfriend but uh  I tell you what the weather wasn't .\\n Is this getting serious.\\n It yeah geh getting reasonably serious.\\n Ooh  righto  no announcements yet.\\n Watch this space. Watch this space. Mate what about the split weekend coming up uh um fixturing uh uh I know we know that Melbourne are probably gunna jump up and down a bit this week with the uh the short break Monday to Saturday.\\n Yeah look uh I I spoke to Ben today about that apparently when the uh fixturing's done the Melbourne uh requested uh to play on the Monday the Queen's Birthday Monday and then the with the turnaround uh on the Sunday uh well I think there was a difficulty playing them with a wuh on the on the Sunday in Melbourne giving the Eagles chance to get back uh on flights or something so uh that was buh my understanding of how that ih situation eventuated.\\n So  no chance like Melbourne's asking it to be moved to Sunday or has asked it be moved onto Sunday there's no chance of that then is there.\\n Look uh not that I'm aware of but again it's really up to y'know Ben Buckley 'n' the uh y'know  the the the fixturing guys to uh to to to uh to deal with any request  like that but not that I'm aware of.\\n Yeah I'm sure Ben obviously knows about this 'cos he's obviously studied it uh but in the N R L as in you might know this too what they do is they have a six week program  and uh every six weeks they revise it 'n' depending on who's playing well 'n' who's not as to who plays in the big games on a Friday night y'know so someone's like ya y'know say Richmond was right down the bottom 'n' you wouldn't want 'em on a Friday night or s or or uh Hawthorn or whatever you'd put someone else in there 'n' then they rejag they rejig it. Is it does that got merit d'ya think.\\n Um I think there's some real negatives in doing that um one of them is that yih wuh by releasing our fixture early y'know people plan their uh years around uh who's playing when and where y'know they might pick pick uh y'know a game where uh y'know the Eagles or Dockers are travelling to either Sydney or Brisbane or  uh Melbourne on any given particular weekend 'n' it gives people the opportunity to plan their uh years around uh um when the games are on and uh if you if you start doing it on a sort of a six weekly type basis you you take away that sort of certainty out of it.\\n Okay 'cos uh I guess the networks'd love it there's no doubt about that. Now I saw you oh you said you were over in the west you were obviously at the Eagles game Friday night um uh at one stah I was at the back there standing behind you at one stage there I saw a a television reporter turn to you and say those umpires . How do you firstly how do you find that and secondly  what about the umpires . Who knows.\\n Oh dear look I I I y'know I think in the uh in the wash up it was probably a pretty even performance by the umpires and I don't think uh y'know either side I think um I'd uh just after he'd finished telling me what  a hard go the Eagles were getting I'd a Essendon supporter telling me what a hard go they were getting  but  no I reckon it's a no-win situation but y'know overall I thought they were pretty good y'know they let the uh the the play go a bit uh in the wet conditions made them um and we saw some really hard desperate footy it was uh it was good to see 'n' I reckon it's fantastic uh y'know f um to see thirty-eight and a half thousand people in those sorta conditions come out 'n' see ih y'know the players real slog it out in those uh conditions was fantastic it was great to be there.\\n Speaking of umpires uh offering fines now to players who collide with uh umpires accidentally or intently 'n' 'n' why wouldn't it of Michael Voss one of our great nates  uh have b have been charged for pushing Kouta into the umpire.\\n Yeah I think hum from  what I can gather .\\n But someone's fired sorry just before I suh just  to add to that wuh uh but what ih what what has happened don't do it again someone says now. I mean.\\n Yeah look  I I think today um one of the players in um said I don't think Voss actually himself made contact with the umpire.\\n No he pushed  Kouta there.\\n But ih if you negligently make contact with an umpire you get fined for that 'n' that's been the case for uh b uh y'know I think a couple of years now but if you recklessly or intentionally make contact with an umpire you're looking at uh a a suspension and if it's intentional y'know probably a lengthy suspension 'n' we s remember Greg Williams's uh suspension was uh y'know for pushing an a uh uh an umpire uh years ago was certainly at the hefty end of the uh scale . Um when you push someone else into an umpire that could amount to something like misconduct 'n' I think uh uh y'know maybe uh Michael got the uh benefit of the doubt there but uh I think the match review panel have made it clear er that um um warning players against that sort of conduct 'n'   I think that's probably um.\\n Wuh a a and look it's becoming apparent too Adrian 'n' I I know you see a lot of football 'n' you're a keen student of it   uh players are using umpires as screens.\\n Yeah look and ih huh um.\\n That's never happened before.\\n Yeah look uh I think when this problem arose a couple of years ago y'know players were uh er were taking a few uh too many liberties in terms of uh positioning themselves behind umpires 'n' um y'know the a clear message was sent that they need to take the responsibility to avoid contact with the umpires 'n' uh I think that um y'know that uh the match review panel's uh uh sent that message uh uh reasonably clearly uh this weekend as well.\\n Couple of other uh g off-air callers that wanted some g ask you some questions one was uh   uh if you take a mark 'n' you go back to take a kick 'n' then you play on 'n' you get tackled uh ih would that be considered prior opportunity.\\n Uh usually that would be oh I think that would be considered prior opportunity but um y'know if there's a split second between uh running off your mark 'n' getting tackled that may not necessarily be y'know prior opportunity or reasonable time but ih if there's any sort of reasonable time in between running o playing on and getting tackled you would expect that uh uh uh a free kick would be payed if it was an incorrect disposal.\\n So just to explain that uh so if somebody gets the ball 'n' they play on and they've had cha a chance to unload it with by either hand or foot and then they get sort of half tackled but they still get a kick away that's holding the ball isn't it.\\n No if you get a kick away if you get a correct disposal away uh th th that's not um uh I mean it's hard to generalise but ih ih in in majority of situations if you get a clean disposal by hand o a handball or a kick away you won't be penalised for holding the ball.\\n Alright that's uh that clears that up because a few people worried about that 'n'  and and Brad's been on about y'know s people sweating on ball winners 'n' that d d gih ih prior opportunity encourages people to do that it's a tagger's paradise.\\n Uh look oh uh I don't think so I think that um uh what we saw last year t p uh was the highest uh rate of secondary bounces ever um when we're talking last year about the game as a spectacle one of the key issues was uh the number of stoppages  and people deliberately holding the ball in and forcing stoppages and absorbing tackles when they had a reasonable opportunity to get rid of the ball  um this year  the umpires have upped the ante a little bit on players when they do have an opportunity to get rid of the ball and the other aspect of the holding the ball rule that a lotta people don't understand I think ih is that and maybe we should communicate better is that even if you haven't had a prior opportunity and you're tackled you still have to make an attempt to get rid of the ball if your arms are free. So if you sit there with your arms free having been tackled and do nothing that is holding the ball under  the uh under the laws of Australian football  you must make an effort.\\n And just one more here Barney sorry uh Cameron Mooney deliberate out of bounds in the Geelong game uh Geelong Adelaide have you id had a chance to look at it and uh what was your view.\\n Yeah I I saw that one uh today um and I asked a uh the the the um I think it was one that they uh found a difficult one to uh adjudicate on because when they look at deliberate you look at they look at a couple of things 'n' and wuh w well for the first question is wuh what's the player's intent well um to work that out they look to y'know ih how much pressure was the player under and uh secondly y'know was there a uh uh how with what sort of force did the ball go over the boundary line and was there a team mate in the vicinity so in this case they said well he was under a lotta pressure he's being tackled  um th uh the team mate uh Ling was in the vicinity but he wasn't right up close to where it was 'n' what sort of force did it go over with did he handball it straight out on the full no it bounced twice before it went over so weighing those things up they thought y'know was a was a was a a line ball one 'n' they um y'know that's about it I guess.\\n Good on you Adrian thanks very much for your time hope you got some nice wine when you were down south.\\n Thanks for having me on guys.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

The phrase here was clearly serving an important function in conjoining the first part of the utterance with the second. This usage seemed to allow the speaker a way to introduce a connected thought without needing to precisely formulate the connection between the two clauses in a way that might be expected in written English.\n","- Looking at the utterances as a whole seems to lend weight to our conjecture that there is no hard-and-fast distinction between the usage of \"I think\" as a feature of Ego-involvement, a reference to the speaker's mental process, and its pragmatic function as a hedge. All the examples could be interpreted as both of these at once; they hedge precisely <i>by</i> making reference to the speaker's mental process. If we imagine what the usage could be as a \"pure\" marker of Ego-involvement, without any hedging function, we could imagine an expression like \"When I look at the night sky, I think of the smallness of our place in the universe\".

These frequent n-grams give us an idea of the topic under discussion in that particular broadcast. For example we can reasonably assume that COMNE5 transcribes a discussion about a legal issue, while NAT2 transcribes a discussion about Australian author Tim Winton.\n","2. <b>Reflexives</b>: These 2-grams refer to a core aspect of the program itself, as opposed to the examples above in <b>1</b>, which referred to topics external to the program. Examples of these include 'book club', 'super request', 'BC' (presumably preceded by 'A' for 'ABC'), 'two g' and 'g b' for the station 2GB, and 'Dr Karl' (a regular co-host of the Triple J segment <i>Science with Dr. Karl</i>: https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/dr-karl-podcast.\n","3. <b>Common Phrases</b>: Finally there are frequently occuring common phrases like the greeting <i>good morning</i>. The frequency of this phrase in particular is likely due to the program's being a call-in show, such that the phrase is frequently repeated whenever a new caller comes on the line. We can see that 'good morning' is the most frequent 2-gram for 5 of the 15 (so 1/3) of the commercial broadcasts, but most frequent for only 1 of the 14 public broadcasts (NAT3), and 2nd most frequent for another (NAT6, which is a transcription of <i>Science with Dr. Karl</i>, a call-in segment. <i>good afternoon</i> is the 2nd most frequent 2-gram for COMNE7, ABCNE1 and ABCNE2. Bednarek (2014) classifies <i>good morning</i> as a form of reply to a questioner's query, generally the caller's response to the host's asking a question like \"how are you?\", and points out that \"in these talkback data, a positive and friendly atmosphere appears to be created through phatic communication\".\n","4.

It is also in particular a feature of TR data: whereas the speech of the host may be constrained by some professional norms, the speech of the guest is not. However, we do learn something about the word 'bling', namely its capacity to remain meaningful even when consecutively repeated many times over. This likely has something to do with its pragmatic function as a <i>flaunt</i> or <i>flex</i>; it does not primarily convey semantic content, but signals an attitude or disposition.
