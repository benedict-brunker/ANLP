   FADE IN: 


   EXT. PANORAMIC VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - SUNSET 


   As we hear ""What is Love"" by HADDAWAY -- night falls and 
   partytime begins. 


   SUPERIMPOSE:  SUNSET BLVD., 11:03 PM 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. DANCE CLUBS - NIGHT 


   Coconut Teaser, The Palace, The Roxbury, Tatou, etc. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. DANCE CLUBS- QUICK SHOTS - NIGHT 


   Of random dancers -- gyrating, flirting, making out, drinking. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. PALACE - NIGHT 


   The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a crowded dance floor -- and 
   SETTLES ON the rhythmically swaying backs of... 


   STEVE & DOUG BUTABI 


   Our heroes.  In their minds, Steve is tall, dark and handsome and DOUG is a little genius. Neither is correct 
   -- except for the tall and little part. 


   They simultaneously turn and scope the room.  In unison, 
   their heads bop to the MUSIC.  Doug steps out from the 
   bar. 


					  DOUG 
				(to O.S. female) 
		   Hey!  You want to dance?  No? 
		   Yes?  Alright, don't worry about 
		   it. 


   Doug, rejected, steps back as Steve steps out. 


					  STEVE 
				(to O.S. female) 
		   Do you want to dance?  You do? 
		   You don't?  Not a problem. 


   They are no strangers to rejection, so neither is fazed. 
   Doug enthusiastically steps towards two attractive girls. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, you wanna...? 


   Two attractive girls turn their backs to Doug. 


					  DOUG 
				(remaining positive) 
		   No?  Maybe I'll see you later. 


   Doug steps back.  Steve spots GIRL AT end of BAR and 
   dances over to her. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, do you want to dance? 


					  GIRL AT BAR 
		   No. 


					  STEVE 
				(cheerfully) 
		   Alright, you know where I'll be. 


   Steve steps back.  Doug sees a pretty woman on a balcony, 
   waving to someone. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
				(pointing to each other) 
		   You want him?  Me?  Him?  Me? 


   Pretty woman waves them off, frustrated, and dissapears. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... Oh, you're okay? 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright then. 


   They turn around to the bar, bartender is standing in 
   front of them. 


					  STEVE 
		   Bartender, can I get a beer? 


   The bartender pays no attention and walks away.  Second 
   bartender comes from the opposite direction. 


					  DOUG 
		   Barkeep, what do you have on tap? 


   The second bartender ignores them, walks away.  The 
   bartenders keep crossing past the, paying no attention. 


					  STEVE 
		   Big guy, could I get a... 


					  DOUG 
		   My man, how 'bout a... 


					  STEVE 
		   S'cuse me, partner... 


					  DOUG 
		   Yo, buddy, I was wondering... you 
		   know what?  Don't worry about it. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, we're good. 


   They turn back to the dance floor and bop.  Suddenly, a 
   HOT GIRL dances in front of them. 


   Doug dances up behind her and frantically gyrates.  She 
   turns away -- only to find... 


   Steve gyrating behind her.  The guys close in on her 
   trapping her in the middle. 


					  HOT GIRL 
		   Get off me! 


   She runs off, furious.  The guys, unaware that she's 
   upset, celebrate. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   Score! 


   They high five.  The doorman comes over with the upset 
   Girl and pulls the guys out. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   What?  What's goin' on?  What's 
		   your problem? 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - NIGHT 


   The road flies by as we PAN UP the front grill of a red 
   BMW to reveal Doug and Steve.  The car stops next to two 
   girls in a white Porshe. 


   INT. BMW - NIGHT 


					  DOUG 
		   We got some sweetness on the left. 


   Doug Turns UP the STEREO really loud so the car is 
   pounding. 


					  STEVE 
				(to the girls) 
		   What's up? 


					  DOUG 
				(to the girls) 
		   How you ladies doin' tonight? 


   INTERCUT GIRLS' POV 


   The guys moving their mouths -- but the girls can't hear 
   them. 


					  GIRL #1 
		   Turn your music down! 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah!  Just follow us! 


					  GIRL #2 
		   You're a big stupid ass! 


					  STEVE 
		   No.  You have beautiful eyes! 


					  DOUG 
		   I like you too! 


					  GIRL #1 
		   Go home, jerkoff! 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay, we'll meet you there. 


   The light turns green.  Girls drive off. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. ROXBURY CLUB - NIGHT 


   A neon sign reads ""ROXBURY."" 


   ROXBURY CLUB FRONT DOOR 


   A huge muscular BOUNCER, wearing a headset, guards the 
   roped off area.  Doug and Steve confidently strut past 
   the crowd. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Stop! 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   What's up? 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Guys, this is the Roxbury.  No one 
		   gets in unless you're on the list. 


					  DOUG 
		   We're on the list. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Names? 


					  DOUG 
		   Doug Butabi. 


					  STEVE 
		   Steve Butabi. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   You're brothers? 


					  DOUG 
		   No... 


   They slowly turn to each other and bust. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   ... Yes! 


   They high five, laughing. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Quite a joke. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug is hilarious. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, I know. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Yeah, you ever hear this one? 
		   You're not on the list. 


   Behind Steve and Doug, a '98 yellow FERRARI SCREECHES up 
   to the valet.  Car door opens and... 


   RICHARD GRIECO 


   gets out.  Looking great, in an Armani suit, beautiful 
   supermodel accompanies him. 


					  STEVE 
				(beside himself) 
		   Is that...? 


					  DOUG 
		   It is.  The King of '21 Jump 
		   Street.'  Richard Grieco. 


   Grieco quickly steps past Steve and Doug. 


					  STEVE 
				(aside to Doug) 
		   Check the wheels. 


					  DOUG 
		   Check the hottie. 


   The Bouncer jumps aside, letting them enter.  Richard 
   inadvertently rubs his nose as he enters. 


   DOUG & STEVE 


   Watching.  They both imitate his nose rub and try to 
   follow him in.  The Bouncer steps in front of them. 


					  DOUG 
				(yelling at Grieco 
				 like they know him) 
		   Alright, we'll see you later then! 
				(to Bouncer) 
		   You know what?  We're gonna take 
		   off now. 


					  STEVE 
		   Maybe we'll hang out later. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   There's no chance of that 
		   happening. 


					  STEVE 
		   Sounds good. 


   The guys exit. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BMW - NIGHT 


   The guys are driving. 


					  DOUG 
		   You know what was wrong with that 
		   place. 


					  STEVE 
		   It's hard to say, since we didn't 
		   get in. 


					  DOUG 
		   It's just a poorly run operation. 
		   They can't properly evaluate the 
		   incoming clientele. 


					  STEVE 
		   I thought we just didn't look cool 
		   enough. 


					  DOUG 
		   C'mon.  You?  You're a beautiful 
		   man.  I tell you what I'd do if it 
		   were my club.  I would treat all 
		   the outside wannabes just as well 
		   as any legendary former television 
		   star. 


					  STEVE 
		   That's pretty Roosevelt of you. 


					  DOUG 
		   It's just what I believe in. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SUNSET BLVD - LATER 


   A police car drives behind them, turns on the SIREN. 


   INT. BMW 


   The sound of the SIREN mixes with their MUSIC. 


					  DOUG 
		   Must be the new dance mix version. 


					  POLICE OFFICER (O.S.) 
				(loud speaker) 
		   Pull over to the side of the road! 


   A female POLICE OFFICER signals them to pull over. 


   DRIVER'S WINDOW 


   The officer steps up to their car. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   You know you were doing fifty? 


					  STEVE 
				(yelling over radio) 
		   What? 


   She reaches in, shuts OFF RADIO -- starts filling out 
   ticket. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   This is a twenty-five mile an hour 
		   zone. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hottie cop likes you. 


					  STEVE 
		   You serious? 


					  DOUG 
		   You think she pulls over anybody? 
		   Mave a move. 


					  STEVE 
				(turning to her) 
		   What's going on? 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   Not much, I'm just giving you an 
		   eighty dollar ticket. 


					  DOUG 
		   She is so into you. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   Can I see your license and 
		   registration? 


   Steve pulls the documents off the sun visor, hands them 
   over. 


					  STEVE 
				(seductively) 
		   I think I got what you're looking 
		   for. 


   She takes it, walks back to police car.  Doug adjusts the 
   rearview mirror. 


   POLICE CAR 


   She's on the radio. 


					  DOUG 
		   She's calling her friends. 


					  STEVE 
		   Seriously? 


					  DOUG 
		   Here she comes. 


					  STEVE 
		   How's my hair? 


   She hands Steve the papers and a ticket. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   I want you to do me a favor. 


					  STEVE 
		   Whatever you say, TJ Hooker. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   Please obey any and all posted 
		   speed limit signs.  Have a good 
		   night. 


					  STEVE 
		   It's already good, now that you've 
		   served and protected me. 


   She laughs it off, walks away.  Doug takes the ticket. 


					  DOUG 
		   Way to go, my friend.  You got her 
		   badge number plus a month from now 
		   you have a date to meet her at the 
		   Municipal State Court.  Up top! 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Score! 


   They high five and PEEL OUT. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. FLORENTINE GARDENS DANCE CLUB - NIGHT 


   This is a very downscale crowd, crappy cars, surrounding a dilapidated building. 


   INT. FLORENTINE GARDENS CLUB - NIGHT 


   Completely packed.  People are physically wedged up 
   against one another. 


					  DOUG 
		   This is what it's all about. 


   A big SECURITY GUY plows through the area. 


					  SECURITY GUY 
		   Folks, we got to keep this area 
		   clear! 


   The crowd moves, sweeping the guys along.  Doug and Steve 
   settle in a different spot. 


					  STEVE 
		   There's a good feeling in here. 


					  ANOTHER SECURITY GUY 
		   People, there's no lingering by 
		   the exits! 


   As it moves, Doug is engulfed in the crowd and 
   disappears. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug?... Hey, Doug!... Whoa! 


   Steve is shoved away as the crowd moves again. 


   DOUG 


   jumps up and pops his head above the crowd. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve! 


   STEVE 


   is wedged into a corner. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug! 


   DOUG 


   pops up near the entrance to the men's room. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve! 


   DANCE FLOOR 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug! 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. MEN'S BATHROOM 


   Doug's face is wedged up against a mirror.  He struggles 
   to pull a cellular phone put of his pocket and dial. 


   INTERCUT WITH: 


   DANCE FLOOR 


   Steve is wedged against a blinking light.  We hear a 
   cellular PHONE RING.  Steve reaches in his pocket and 
   pulls out his phone. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hello? 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, it's Doug. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, hey, Doug.  So, what's going on? 


					  DOUG 
		   Not much.  Where are you? 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't know.  Where are you? 


   Doug gets pushed up against a urinal. 


					  DOUG 
		   There's a lot of guys pulling down 
		   their pants, so it's either the 
		   bathroom or the V.I.P room.  Meet 
		   me back at the bar.  If I don't 
		   make it, I'll see you tommorow at
		   home. 


   DOUG hangs up.  O.S.  we hear someone UNZIP. 


					  DOUG 
				(panicked) 
		   Hey, just hold on a second. 


   Doug moves away. 


   INT. DANCE FLOOR - LATER THAT NIGHT 


   Two very bored club girls are standing up against a wall. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, anyway, I'm standing there 
		   waiting to use the pay phone... 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, he was.  Seriously. 


					  DOUG 
		   And this guy who's on the phone 
		   turns around and tips his hat like 
		   this. 


   DOUG does a ""tip your hat"" motion. 


					  STEVE 
		   And who do you think the guy was? 


   Girls still stone-faced. 


					  DOUG 
		   Emilio Estevez. 


					  STEVE 
		   The Mighty Duckman.  Swear to God. 
		   I was there. 


					  DOUG 
				(teasing) 
		   Of course, you were.  You're the 
		   one who yelled the breakfast 
		   clubber's name. 


					  STEVE 
		   I was like -- 'Emilioooo!' 


					  DOUG 
		   So, anyway... you guys want to 
		   make out or what? 


   The girls stare at them. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. AM/PM MIN-MART GAS STATION - NIGHT 


   The guys pull up.  Doug gets out and starts to pump gas. 


					  DOUG 
		   Score some chippage.  I'll meet 
		   you in there. 


   Steve exits into the AM/PM.  Doug notices a woman puttng   
   gas into her car.  She feins a smile, looks away. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey! 


   Doug starts pulling the pump in and out of the gas
   tank -- simulating copulation.  She's repulsed. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. AM/PM -- CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Steve looking at a bag of Pork Rinds.  Doug comes up from 
   behind. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, she's totally looking at you. 


					  STEVE 
		   Who? 


   Doug motions toward the CASHIER.  She snaps her gum and 
   is reading People magazine. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ask her where the chips are. 


					  STEVE 
		   But, I know where they are. 


   DOUG pushes him.  Steve walks over to the Cashier. 


					  STEVE 
		   Excuse me, I'm looking for the 
		   potato chips.  You know, chips 
		   made out of potato. 


					  CASHIER 
		   They're right behind you. 


					  STEVE 
		   Wow, you really know what's going 
		   on, don't you? 


   He turns away and pretends to look at the chips.  Doug 
   gives him a thumbs up. 


   Richard Grieco enters the store and walks up to the 
   Cashier.  She lights up, recognizing Grieco. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, look. 


   Doug and Steve walk up to Grieco. 


					  DOUG 
				(trying to be cool) 
		   Hey. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   ... Hey. 


					  DOUG 
		   Remember us?  We were at the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Grieco) 
		   We were outside? 


   Grieco turns to Cashier. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Could I get a pack of Marlboro 
		   Lights and that 12-pack of 
		   Trojans.  Thanks. 


   Cashier rings it up,  hands it to him. 


					  CASHIER 
				(obviously enamored) 
		   Thanks. 


   Grieco exits, they all watch.  Steve approaches Cashier. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, I think I'm gonna need a 12- 
		   pack of Trojans over there. 


					  CASHIER 
		   You know, they expire in two 
		   years. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 


   Doug and Steve watch Grieco's Ferrari drive off as they 
   sit on the car and eat Pork Rinds. 


					  DOUG 
		   That nabob has got it going on. 


					  STEVE 
				(sadly envious) 
		   Kickin' it at the Roxbury, rollin' 
		   a banana Ferrari. 


					  DOUG 
		   Tasty geisha by his side. 


					  STEVE 
		   The man is a bag of chips. 


					  DOUG 
				(correcting him) 
		   All that and a bag of chips. 


					  STEVE 
		   Right.  Well, we're doing okay.  I 
		   got a number tonight. 


					  DOUG 
				(thrilled) 
		   Let me see it! 


   Steve hands him a cocktail napkin.  Doug reads it. 


					  DOUG 
		   555...?  Steve, this isn't real. 
		   It's one of those fake T.V. 
		   numbers. 


					  STEVE 
		   Is not. 


					  DOUG 
		   Is, too.  I get this number all 
		   the time. 


					  STEVE 
		   At least she respected me enough 
		   to write a fake number.  We'll get 
		   a real one one of these days. 


					  DOUG 
		   One of these days?  Steve, don't 
		   you get it?  These are our days. 
		   Now!  Today!  Ahora! 


					  STEVE 
		   Ah whatta? 


   Doug jumps off the car, starts pacing. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, we're young.  We're 
		   supposed to purge ourselves of the 
		   party virus or we'll just get so 
		   clogged up that when we're like 
		   forty we'll just explode. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, like one of those individual 
		   plastic butters you get in the 
		   diner.  You know, like when you 
		   squish it, just bursts out all 
		   over the place. 


   Steve makes explosion sound. 


					  DOUG 
		   Forget the butter, Steve.  I'm 
		   trying to explain -- 


					  STEVE 
				(interrupting) 
		   Or like when you put an egg in a 
		   microwave and all the yellow stuff 
		   flies out. 


   He mimes exploding egg. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's an exceptional way to 
		   visualize it but listen to me. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh!  Remember in camp when we put 
		   that can of beans in the fire? 


					  DOUG 
		   And it exploded.  Yes.  Steve!  If 
		   we're ever going to live up to our 
		   full potential, we've got to get 
		   this partying out of our systems 
		   now. 


					  STEVE 
		   Let's do it. 


   They both get in the car. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BMW - NIGHT 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Alright, let's do it!  Do it! 
		   Woo! 


					  STEVE 
		   ... Do what?  Everything's closed. 


   Beat. 


					  DOUG 
		   Then let's go home. 


					  STEVE 
				(excited) 
		   Let's go home!  Wooo! 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - MORNING 


   The house is a bad '80s combination of classical styles. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 


   We PAN AROUND to see semi-juvenile furniture -- which is 
   overwhelmed by a huge stereo system. 


   Doug sleeps, mouth open.  A piece of red licorice reaches 
   INTO FRAME and starts darting in and out of Doug's mouth. 
   He coughs and waves it away.  The licorice starts going 
   up his nostril.  Doug wakes up. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey!  Knock it off! 


					  STEVE 
		   Twizzled you, my friend. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, you totally got me. 


   STEVE laughs at this, starts eating the licorice. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was in my nose. 


   Steve stops eating. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. KITCHEN -- DAY 


   Two giant Great Danes plow through, knocking over plates. 
   We meet their dad, KAMEHL BUTABI, fifties, Eugene Levi- 
   type, with some sort of Middle Eastern accent. 


					 MR. BUTABI 
		  Captain!  Tenille!  Stop that! 


   Steve and Doug, in silk bathrobes, hair completely 
   disheveled, enter. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Look at this.  Barbara, look who's 
		   honoring us with their presence. 


   We meet their mom, BARBARA BUTABI, well kept trophy wife. 
   She tries to straighten out their hair. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Ma!... come on. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
				 (handing Doug orange 
				  juice) 
		  Here... 


					  DOUG 
				(rejecting juice) 
		   Mom, I'm trying to get my body to 
		   enter the zone, so I can optimize 
		   my fat-burning potential, and 
		   orange juice does not help! 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, according to 'Fit for Life' 
		   the idea of a balanced breakfast 
		   is a fallacy.  Your body is only 
		   prepared to accept one form of 
		   food in the A.M. -- fruit. 


   Steve grabs the glass. 


					  DOUG 
		   You can putrefy your insides if 
		   you want to.  But, I'm having a 
		   cup of cooked oatmeal, one 
		   tablespoon protein power... 


   As Doug continues, Mr. Butabi gets more and more annoyed. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... and four soy sausage links. 
				(to Steve) 
		   That's how you hit your peak. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(sarcastic) 
		   Quick, Barbara, look at Doug.  He 
		   is hitting his peak.  You don't 
		   want to miss this. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Honey, if you're going to hit your 
		   peak, do it in your room. 


					  STEVE 
		   All I want for breakfast is some 
		   sliced mangos and persimmons. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   That's enough, you two.  Your 
		   mother is not the maid. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, can you tell the maid I want 
		   some sliced mangos and persimmons? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I want you both at work in half an 
		   hour.  And, Steve wear something 
		   nice.  Emily's back from school. 


					  DOUG 
		   Excuse me, Dad, but I think you're 
		   confusing Steve for someone who 
		   gives a flying rat's ass. 


					  STEVE 
		   Wow, a flying rat's ass.  That 
		   would be wild to see. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Kamehl, they'll be there.  Just 
		   let them have their breakfast. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Sure.  Eat.  They need their 
		   strength so they can stay out all 
		   night for their dancing and their 
		   orgies. 


					  STEVE 
		   For your information, Dad, Doug 
		   and I were not able to find an 
		   orgy last night. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Barbara, explain something to me. 
		   They graduate from high school and what 
		   do they do?  Nothing.  Do they go 
		   to college?  No.  Do they take any 
		   intrest in my business?  No.  Do 
		   they think about the future?  No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, if you know all the answers, 
		   why do you keep asking the questions? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Half an hour.  I want to see your 
		   dance club asses at the store. 


   Mr. Butabi exists. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. RODEO DRIVE - SIDEWALK- AFTERNOON 


   ""Staying Alive"" by the BEE GEES.  Set of shoes walking, a 
   la the opening of Saturday Night Fever. 


   We WIDEN to another set of shoes -- PAN UP to reveal Doug 
   and Steve, strutting down the street like John Travolta. 
   Each holds a silk plant. 


   INT. STORE WINDOW - CELL PHONE 


   We see the guys pass.  They stop and hold up their cell 
   phone to the one in the window -- same way Travolta did 
   with the shoe. 


   A beautiful WOMAN walks by.  They turn to look at her 
   ass.  They run back and stand in front of her. She 
   pushes them aside. 


					  WOMAN 
		   Jerks. 


  She exits.  They continue.  They pass a cappucino 
  cart. 


					  CAPPUCINO SALESMAN 
		   Single or double? 


   They look at each other to confirm their choice. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   Double. 


   They walk with their iced cappucinos in bubble top cups 
   with straws.  MUSIC FADES. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK PLANT STORE - LATER 


   Steve and Doug enter holding silk plants.  Mr. Butabi 
   walks up to them, takes the plants.  Doug is wearing a 
   Walkman. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Good.  Steve, you have a customer. 
		   Doug, go ring that man up. 


   They both nod agreeably.  Steve exists.  Doug doesn't 
   move, still listening to the Walkman.  Mr. Butabi pulls 
   his walkman off and points at the register.  Doug exists. 


   CASH REGISTER COUNTER 


   Doug steps behind the counter, helping a COUPLE with several silk floral arrangements. 


					  DOUG 
		   How will you be paying for this? 
		   Cash, check or charge? 


					  MAN 
				(pulling it out) 
		   Charge. 


					  DOUG 
			    (looking at it) 
		   Visa, Mastercard, or Discover? 


					  MAN 
		   Move your thumb. 


   Doug moves it. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh... Visa.  Good one. 


   Doug makes a ""you got me"" motion.  He slides the card 
   through. 


					  DOUG 
		   I think something's wrong with 
		   your card.  You sure this is 
		   yours?  'Cause it's not 
		   processing. 


					  MAN 
		   It's my card. 


					  DOUG 
		   I better call it in. 


   Doug calls. 


					  DOUG 
		   Operator 238 please. 


   INTERCUT WITH: 


   INT. CREDIT SWITCHBOARD -- CONTINIOUS ACTION 


   SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR, with headset, in front of computer, 
   answers phone. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Authorization.  Card number? 


					  DOUG 
		   What's up? 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Doug, I told you not to call anymore. 


					  DOUG 
		   I got to get an approval. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   The card's fine. 


					  DOUG 
		   Not the card, sweetness.  Me. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Shut up and swipe it. 


					  DOUG 
		   I can go for that. 


   Doug swipes it through. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... that feel good?  'Cause I 
		   could swipe it all night. 


   Doug keeps swiping it.  The couple looks at each other. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   It's fine.  Good-bye. 


   She hangs up.  Doug happily hangs up. 


					  DOUG 
				(notices couple 
				 still waiting) 
		   ... Oh, can I help you with 
		   something? 


   ROW OF SILK FERNS 


   A middle-aged lady CUSTOMER is perusing.  Steve walks up. 


					  STEVE 
		   Excuse me, may I show you around 
		   the Silk Garden.  Home of a 
		   wondrous variety of flora and 
		   fauna -- all made of silk. 


					  CUSTOMER #1 
		   Are these supposed to be ferns? 


					  STEVE 
		   That's what people will say.  But 
		   guess what? 


					  CUSTOMER #1 
		   What? 


					  STEVE 
				(whispers in ear) 
		   ... it's not real.  It's silk. 
				(acting in shock) 
		   Oh, be careful! 


					  CUSTOMER #1 
		   What's wrong? 


					  STEVE 
		   You've accidentally wandered into 
		   the Enchanted Forest.  Allow me to 
		   be your guide. 


   Steve ducks behind the four or five silk trees that make 
   up the ""forest"" and sticks his head out from between two 
   trees -- now wearing a safari hat.  He picks up a    watering pot, tips it on a plant -- nothing comes out. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know what I just did? 


					  CUSTOMER #3 
		   What? 


					  STEVE 
		   I just watered your plant for a 
		   whole year. 


							   CUE TO: 


   LITTLE DIORAMA OF NIGHT 


   It's a show box on the register counter, cut up silk 
   flowers inside.  Doug is making two figures dance. 


					  DOUG 
				(male voice) 
		   What's up?  You want to dance? 
				(female voice) 
		   With you.  Oh, God, yes. 


   Doug slams the figures together, singing a dance song. 
   Mr. Butabi enters. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   What are you doing? 


   Doug pulls the diorama away. 


					  DOUG 
		   Not much. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You don't spend enough time in 
		   dance clubs?  You have to cut up 
		   my plants, and make toys of them? 


					  DOUG 
		   This club had a jungle theme. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(calling off) 
		   Carlos!  Come work the cash 
		   register. 
				(to Doug) 
		   You get your brother and load 
		   the truck. 


   CARLOS, middle-aged assistant manager, steps behind 
   counter.  Doug grabs the diorama and exits. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. STOREFRONT - LATER 


   Next door to ""BUTABI'S SILK GARDEN"" is ""BRIGHT IDEA"" lamp 
   store.  Steve gingerly loads a tree into the store van. 
   Doug tosses his in. 


					  EMILY (O.S.) 
		   Steve!  Steve! 


   Steve starts to turn.  Doug tries to stop him. 


					  DOUG 
		   Don't look! 


   EMILY ANDERSON, a plain over-eager girl, early 20s, 
   bounces out of the lamp store, holding a CHANDELIER in 
   one hand that TINKLES every time she moves. 


					  EMILY 
		   Hi, Steve.  Hey, Doug. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Emily. 


					  DOUG 
				(turning away) 
		   Whatever. 


					  STEVE 
		   So, I guess you're back from 
		   school and working in the lamp 
		   store again. 


					  EMILY 
		   Yeah, I missed you. 


					  DOUG 
		   Pardon me.  I got to talk to my 
		   brother a second. 


   Doug pulls Steve aside. 


					  DOUG 
		   What, do you like her or something? 


					  STEVE 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Then why are you talking to her? 


					  STEVE 
		   She's talking to me. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, look at me.  It is your 
		   destiny to be with a variety of lady 
		   girls.  Not just one lamp store 
		   troll.  And quite frankly, your level 
		   of looks is way above her level of 
		   looks.  So for her own good, just 
		   walk away. 


					  STEVE 
		   You are so smart. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's why I'm here. 


					  EMILY 
		   So, Steve, you gonna ask me out 
		   'cause I think we could have a really 
		   good time... 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, that sounds good. 


   Doug annoyed, steps between them. 


					  DOUG 
		   Back off, chicklet! 


					  EMILY 
		   What's your problem.  Doug? 


					  DOUG 
		   Emily, I don't know if you know 
		   this, but my brother and I?  We 
		   live life in the fast lane.  That 
		   means no stop signs, no red 
		   lights, and no pulling over to 
		   take pictures.  Now you see this 
		   man over here? 


   Doug motions to Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   What's up? 


					  DOUG 
		   He's my co-pilot on this magic 
		   carpet ride.  It's a two-man 
		   operation.  One -- two -- 
				(points at Emily) 
		   -- crowd. 


					  EMILY 
		   Shut up, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sh!  I just don't want you to get 
		   hurt. 


   Their father walks over. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Emily! 


					  EMILY 
		   Hi, Mr. Butabi. 


   Their father puts his arm around Steve. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You know my son, Steve, here, 
		   likes you. 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, come on! 


   Doug, frustrated, walks away.  FRED ANDERSON, Emily's 
   overweight father, walks over, also holding a CHANDELIER 
   and TINKLING, puts his arm around Emily. 


					  FRED 
				(gregarious) 
		   Mr. Butabi, is Steve asking Emily 
		   to marry him again?  Ha, ha. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Ha, ha, with the way they carry on, I 
		   think they're already planning their 
		   honeymoon, Mr. Anderson. 


					  FRED 
		   Ha.  Ha.  Did I tell you?  I've 
		   already booked a wedding band. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Ha.  Ha.  Yes, and if they have 
		   enough grandchildren we won't have to 
		   hire salesmen anymore.  Ha, ha, ha... 


   Doug stands behind them and mocks laughing along with 
   them. 


					  FRED 
		   Kamehl, you kill me. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   No, you kill me.  You murder me. 


					  FRED 
				(as he walks away) 
		   ... salesmen.  That's great. 


   Emily waves good-bye to Steve. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, can you just leave Steve alone? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   What?  Your brother likes the girl. 


					  DOUG 
		   No, he doesn't. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, I don't. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, nothing personal, but Emily's 
		   like a pigwoman from a planet of pig 
		   people.  And she's trying to take 
		   Steve on her porky little spaceship 
		   so she can take him back to the 
		   Planet Pig! 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Doug, you know what they eat on 
		   the Pig Planet?  Bacon and sausage. 


					  DOUG 
				(laughing) 
		   Nice call. 


   They high five. 


					  STEVE 
		   Every once in a while I'll hit pay 
		   dirt. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   This is all too bad, because that 
		   girl is going to be his wife. 


					  DOUG 
		   No, she's not. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Doug) 
		   You know, they could also eat ham. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Enough of pig talk.  Doug, do you 
		   see this wall?  When they marry, 
		   we can knock it down.  Then 
		   combine stores and have the first 
		   plant/lamp store.  And Steve and 
		   Emily can run it and it's up to 
		   them if they want to keep you 
		   around. 


					  DOUG 
		   Are you seeing planes?  Is your 
		   name Tatu?  Because I think you're 
		   living on Fantasy Island. 


					  STEVE 
		   God, that was a sweet show. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, I have a fantasy.  That I 
		   have two capable sons who listen 
		   to me.  Look how you load the 
		   truck.  You've done enough damage 
		   for one day.  Get out of here. 
		   I'm sick of both of you! 


   Their father slams the van closed and exits into the 
   store. 
 

					 STEVE 
		   So, we're on a break? 


					  DOUG 
		   I guess. 


					  STEVE 
		   You want to Crunch it? 


					  DOUG 
		   Sure, I'll Crunch. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CRUNCH GYM - STEVE AND DOUG'S POV - DAY 


   of the cardiovascular room.  Long line of stairmasters, 
   treadmills, etc.  We PASS people working out. 


					  DOUG (O.S.) 
		   What's up, Stacey? 


   STACEY rolls her eyes at them and turns away. 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
		   Patty, work it. 


					  PATTY 
		   Shut up. 


					  DOUG (O.S.) 
		   Ritchie, you're the man. 


					  RITCHIE 
		   Fuck off. 


   The guys stop to look at a WOMAN on the inner thigh 
   machine.  She opens and closes her legs, notices them. 


					  WOMAN 
		   What? 


   They look back up and walk away. 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
		   Tom-meee! 


   Steve raises his hand to high five a bodybuilder, who 
   ignores them. 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
		   Catch you later. 


   INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 


   A huge muscle guy is looking in the mirror as he pumps a 
   barbell.  Doug and Steve step over.  This is the first 
   time we see them, in their gym attire -- tight Spandex 
   pants, mesh tank tops and giant weight belts. 


					  DOUG 
		   Excuse me, can the rest of us use 
		   the mirror? 


   The muscle guy moves over.  Doug picks up a small    dumbbell.  Steve spots. 


					  DOUG 
				(pumps it) 
		   How's my form? 


					  STEVE 
		   Looking good.  Relax the 
		   shoulders... breathe through it... 
		   lift don't swing... feel the 
		   burn... stitch in time... and let 
		   me hear this one... 


					  DOUG 
				(screaming) 
		   Aaaaaaaaah! 


   Steve joins in. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 


   Doug finishes, drops dumbbell. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sweet pump.  Got some veinage 
		   going. 


   Two girls walk over. 


					  DOUG 
				(whispers to Steve) 
		   Ask me what time it is. 


					  STEVE 
		   But I know what time it is. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hotties. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh... 
				(loudly) 
		   Excuse me, do you know what time 
		   it is? 


					  DOUG 
		   Sure, Let me check my watch. 


   Doug elaborately twists his arm to look at his watch -- 
   flexing his triceps and displaying them to their full 
   advantage. 


					  DOUG 
		   I... think it's... quarter three. 


   Doug stays unnaturally in that position till the girls 
   leave.  He relaxes. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ladies love triceps. 


   CRAIG, an overenthusiastic trainer, steps up to them. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Doug!  Steve!  What's up? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Craig! 


					  CRAIG 
		   Looking large, gentlemen.  You 
		   guys want the rest of my power 
		   bar? 


   -- holding it up. 


					  DOUG 
				(holding it up) 
		   No, we got a Nitro bar. 


					  CRAIG 
				(holding it up) 
		   How 'bout an Energy Booster Bar? 


					  STEVE 
				(holding it up) 
		   No, we got a Muscle Triplicator 
		   Bar. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Okay, but let me know if you need 
		   some carbs.  I got a case of 
		   'carbolicious' in the back.  But 
		   supplements aside, can I get some 
		   quality time with you fellas? 


					  DOUG 
		   We're in between sets.  Lay it on. 


					  CRAIG 
		   How long we been friends? 


					  STEVE 
		   All seven years of high school. 


					  CRAIG 
		   That's right.  That's why I got to be 
		   real with you now.  And I'm not gonna 
		   sugar coat it.  As a professional 
		   trainer,  I'm a little worried about 
		   your pecs.  You guys don't go all the 
		   way down.  It's called full 
		   extension.  And I'm not seeing it. 


					  DOUG 
		   Craig, you're right.  We actually had 
		   a long talk about that the other 
		   night. 


					  CRAIG 
		   I just don't want you to cheat 
		   yourselves.  I'm sorry I had to come 
		   down on you like this, but in a weird 
		   way, that's my job. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, that's why we love you and we 
		   hate you. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Still friends? 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   You know it. 


					  CRAIG 
		   I'm glad we had this talk. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, we don't talk, we do. 


   They all nod. 


   INT. AEROBICS CLASS - LATER 


   A very fit AEROBICS TEACHER stands on a mini-stage. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   Okay, everybody, I'm Shelley.  Are 
		   you ready to Cardio-Funk? 


					  CROWD (O.S.) 
		   Yeah! 


					  DOUG 
			  No!... Yes! 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, man, you are hilarious. 


   They high-five.  MUSIC STARTS.  ""MOVE YOUR BODY"" by 
   Amber. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   Okay!  Here comes the countdown! 
		   Three... two... one! 


   PAN a line of aerobicizers.  Everyone is in synch -- 
   except Doug and Steve, who work out chaotically. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   ... and kick! 


   Everyone kicks.  But, they continue their hyper dance. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   ... and reach. 


   Everyone reaches.  They continue being out of synch. 


   Suddenly, they stop, put fingers on their necks and stare 
   up at a clock.  Simultaneously, they go right back into 
   their manical dance. 


   MUSIC ENDS.  Everyone but Doug and Steve stop.  People 
   stare at them.  They continue in silence, then slowly 
   wind down as they notice people staring. 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright!  Yeah! 


					  STEVE 
		   Cardio-funk! 


					  DOUG 
		   Thank you, Shelley! 


   Shelley stares at them.  After a few uncomfortable beats. 
  


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   ... what's up? 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. CRUNCH GYM - AFTERNOON 


   Doug and Steve simultaneously put on their sunglasses. 


					  STEVE 
		   Should we go back to work? 


					  DOUG 
		   Probably. 


					  STEVE 
		   What do you want to do? 


					  DOUG 
		   We shaked it, let's bake it. 


   They walk off. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON 


   Guys drive along highway in BMW.  Ocean on one side. 
   Steve stares off at the ocean. 


					 STEVE 
		   Water. 


					   DOUG 
		   Where? 


					  STEVE 
		   There. 


   Doug turns. 


					  DOUG 
		   Right. 


   EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON 


   We see Steve and Doug, waist up.  They have lotion caked 
   up unevenly on themselves. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know, I told Dad we should put 
		   some ferns and some silk banana 
		   trees in front of the store. 
		   'Cause then passersby and the like 
		   could see 'em and we could attract 
		   more customers. 


					  DOUG 
				(unsure what he just 
				 heard) 
		   Moonwalk that by me again? 


					  STEVE 
		   I just said I was talking to Dad 
		   about the store and... 


					  DOUG 
		   The store?  You're sitting around 
		   thinking about the store? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah. 


					  DOUG 
		   Why? 


					  STEVE 
		   That's where we work. 


					  DOUG 
				(exploding) 
		   That's right.  And is that all you 
		   want to do with your life?  Is 
		   that all you think we're capable 
		   of doing -- 


   Two hot bikini babes walk past them.  Guys immediately 
   stop arguing and turn.  We -- 


							   CUT TO: 


   SAME SCENE - WIDE ANGLE 


   -- to see the guys full body, for the first time. 
   They're wearing black Gucci G-string bathing suits.  They 
   flex and hold uncomfortable body positions to show off 
   their muscles. 


					  DOUG 
		   What's up? 


					  STEVE 
		   Want to go for a swim or what? 


					  DOUG 
				(strangled, twisting 
				 arm unnaturally) 
		   ... about quarter after... five 


   The girls walk away.  The guys stop flexing and resume 
   their argument. 


					  DOUG 
		   -- capable of doing with our 
		   lives! 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Doug, why are you Mt. St. 
		   Helensing on me? 


					  DOUG 
		   Because I want more for you.  I 
		   care about you. 


					  STEVE 
		   That is so sweet of you. 


					  DOUG 
		   I know.  And you deserve better. 
		   You deserve to get into the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, there's a list.  You have to 
		   be like a Richard Grieco type guy. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, we are the Richard Grieco type 
		   guys.  We should be on that list. 
		   We're 'A' club people leading a 
		   'B' club life. 


					  STEVE 
		   We've been going to 'B' Clubs? 
		   Why didn't you ever tell me this? 


					  DOUG 
		   I didn't want to hurt your feelings. 
		   I know how sensitive you are. 


					  DOUG 
		   'Cause we settle.  'Cause we keep 
		   going to all those 'B' clubs ever 
		   night  They can smell 'B' club on us 
		   like barf in a bathroom.  From now 
		   on, the only club we go to is the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
		   But, how -- 


					  DOUG 
		   But, nothing. 


					  STEVE 
		   We can't -- 


					  DOUG 
		   We can.  And we will.  Because no 
		   matter how many lists and roped 
		   off areas the big bouncer in the 
		   sky throws in front of us, we will 
		   get through.  You know why? 


					  STEVE 
		   We're good-looking? 


					  DOUG 
		   Very good-looking.  You especially. 
		   Now, repeat after me. 


					  STEVE 
		   'After me.'  Sorry.  I'm just 
		   kidding. 


					  DOUG 
				(completely serious) 
		   And it was hysterical.  I'm just not 
		   laughing to preserve the drama of the 
		   previous moment. 


					  STEVE 
		   Understood.  Continue. 


					  DOUG 
		   Repeat after me.  We can get in the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
		   We can get into the Roxbury. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   Roxbury!  Roxbury!  Roxbury! 


   They leap up and down.  Two girls walk by.  They 
   immediately stop. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   What's up? 


								   CUT TO: 


   INT. BUTABI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


   Mr. Butabi, Mrs. Butabi, Fred Anderson, MABEL ANDERSON, 
   Fred's middle America wife, and Emily are having coffee 
   in the living room.  Emily is obviously dressed up to 
   attract Steve. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(mid-conversation) 
		   ... And then, and I swear this is 
		   true, someone came into the store 
		   today and thought it was a real 
		   plant store. 


					  MABEL 
		   No? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I would not kid about that. 


   Doug and Steve burst in, still in their black Gucci G- 
   strings, head up the stairs. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Hello? 


   Doug and Steve turn. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey. 


					  STEVE 
		   What's up? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   The Andersons here.  Get dressed 
		   and come join us. 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve!  Sorry, Dad, we're busy 
		   tonight. 


					  EMILY 
		   I like your bathing suit, Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   Thanks Emily. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, again! 


					  STEVE 
		   I mean, whatever, Emily. 


					  DOUG 
		   Nice to see you, folks. 


   The guys rush upstairs.  Suddenly, we hear MUSIC pounding 
   from their room. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Excuse me a minute. 


   Mr. Butabi goes upstairs. 


   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT 


   The guys are picking out their clothes in the closet 
   Mr. Butabi enters and shuts off the MUSIC. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   If I tell you to do something, you 
		   do it.  And what is this business 
		   of coming in naked.  Put on your 
		   pants and come down. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ain't on our 'Things to do' list. 
		   Daddy-o.  Steve and I have 
		   something extremely important to 
		   do tonight. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, to come downstairs. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad! 


   Doug goes in their bathroom and slams the door. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Why can I not get through to him? 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, Doug is like a fax machine. 
		   You just keep putting things in, 
		   face down, and you need to have a 
		   cover page, because if you don't 
		   -- people don't know where it's 
		   coming from and sometimes you 
		   don't get through on the first 
		   call.  That's why you got a redial 
		   button and a memory button 
		   because... you know... actually, I 
		   never use those buttons.  I always 
		   screw it up.  I don't know. 


   Doug opens the bathroom door. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Steve) 
		   Don't try to explain it to him. 
		   He'll never understand. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Oh, I understand.  You are going 
		   out tonight. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's right. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I just don't understand what 
		   you're driving. 


   Mr. Butabi takes their keys off the dresser and grabs 
   their cell phones and starts to exit. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Hey!  Dad!  What are you doing! 


   Mr. Butabi exits. 


   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 


   Emily is standing, singing ""Memories"" from Cats. 
   Everyone is listening. 


					  EMILY 
		   'Memories, all alone in the 
		   moonlight...' 


   Fred nods ""isn't she good"" to Kamehl, who agrees. 


   Steve and Doug, dressed to kill, stomp down the stairs. 
   Doug turns to Mr. Butabi. 


					  DOUG 
		   You can take away our phones.  You 
		   can take away our keys.  But, you 
		   can't take away our dreams! 


					  STEVE 
		   That's right.  'Cause we're like 
		   sleeping when we have them. 


					  DOUG 
		   Later much. 


   The guys exit.  Steve pauses a moment. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, nice voice. 


					  DOUG (O.S.) 
		   Steve! 


   Steve exits. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Mrs. Butabi runs after them, holding old brick-sized 
   cell phones. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Boys!  Boys! 


   The guys stop. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   I don't like you going out without 
		   a phone.  What if something 
		   happens? 


   She hands them the cell phones. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ma, these are embarrassing. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Take it in case of emergency. 


   She kisses them and walks back in. 


					  DOUG 
		   Did Ma get lipstick on me? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, but it looks like you were 
		   making out. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, good. 


   In b.g., Mom gets knocked over by Great Danes.  No one 
   notices. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - LATER 


   We see the van driving down the street. 


   INT. SILK GARDEN VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug Pulls down sun visor, checks his hair.  Tries rear- 
   view mirror -- still good.  Then leans across Steve, 
   who's driving, and looks in the driver's side 
   view mirror -- still good. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, how's my hair? 


					  STEVE 
		   Looks good. 


					  DOUG 
		   Roxbury good? 


					  STEVE 
		   You know it.  How do I look? 


					  DOUG 
		   Robust and attractive.  I gotta 
		   tell you -- tonight, I can taste 
		   it. 


   Steve doesn't respond and suddenly SLAMS the BRAKES. 
   Doug gets thrown forward. 


					  STEVE 
				(completely losing 
				 it) 
		   I can't taste it, Doug!  I can't! 
		   I'm so scared right now I don't 
		   know what to do! 


					  DOUG 
				(calming him down) 
		   Bro, you're mad cowing on me. 
		   Relax. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm nervous, man.  We've put all 
		   this pressure on ourselves to get 
		   into the Roxbury, and I don't know 
		   if we can deliver! 


					  DOUG 
		   You gotta take control of yourself. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, you gotta take control!  I am 
		   barely hanging on here!... You... 


   Steve starts crying.  Doug cradles him. 


					  DOUG 
		   Whoa... settle down... relax... 
		   think puppies and candy canes... 
		   easy... 


   Doug notices two girls walking by the van. 


					  DOUG 
		   What's up? 


					  STEVE 
				(completely 
				 recovered) 
		   How you doing, little lady? 


   From O.S., a beer BOTTLE flies INTO FRAME at them and 
   SMASHES on the van. 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright.  Maybe later then. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and 
		   I hate to be the one to burst it.  I 
		   just don't think our names are on 
		   that list. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, get real.  The bouncer isn't 
		   checking a list.  He's checking us. 
		   Man, I can't believe all this time, 
		   that's what you thought. 


					  STEVE 
		   So, why didn't we ever get in before? 


					  DOUG 
		   We were kids.  We were completely 
		   immature. 


					  STEVE 
		   But that was last night.  And now we 
		   don't even have our car. 


					  DOUG 
		   Perfect.  Rites of passage.  Like 
		   that Africa show on P.B.S.  When it's 
		   time for a boy to become a man, they 
		   send him to the jungle with nothing 
		   but a spear to hunt the lion 
		   The van is our spear and the Roxbury is 
		   our lion.  And when the hunt is over, 
		   we shall be men. 


					  STEVE 
		   Does the bouncer know about this? 


					  DOUG 
		   Look, Steve, what really matters 
		   is that at the end of the night -- 
		   when all is said and done and all 
		   hotties have been hit upon -- if 
		   either of us has just one girl's 
		   number, just one, then we'll know, 
		   for the first time in our lives, 
		   we're really worth something. 


   EXT. ROXBURY CLUB - NIGHT 


   The guys pull up -- get out.  Steve tosses Doug the keys. 
   Doug tosses the keys to the valet -- who ignores them. 
   Keys fall to the ground.  Doug runs over, picks up keys 
   -- hands them to the valet.  Walks back to Steve. 


					  DOUG 
		   Storm the castle. 


					  STEVE 
		   Take no prisoners. 


   Doug and Steve try to walk/bop up to the Bouncer.  They 
   wave to people who aren't there, trying to act cool, and 
   attempt to walk in.  Bouncer stops them. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, my good hombre, remember us 
		   from last night? 


					  BOUNCER 
		   No. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug and Steve Butabi. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   You're brothers? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   No... Yes! 


					  STEVE 
		   Works every time. 


   They laugh hysterically. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Now, I remember.  You can't come in. 


   A flashy guy walks past them, in SLOW MOTION, slapping a 
   fifty dollar bill into the Bouncer's hand and entering. 


					  DOUG 
				(aside to Steve) 
		   Okay, it's time to play a little 
		   softball. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hello, my good man.  How's it going 
		   tonight? 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Good.  You're still not getting in. 


					   DOUG 
		   Well, that's not what a good 
		   friends of mine told me.  Maybe you 
		   know him?  His name is Abraham. 


   Doug drops a five dollar bill on the Bouncer's clipboard. 
   The Bouncer doesn't move. 


					  DOUG 
		   You don't know him? 


					  STEVE 
		   How 'bout his two friends?  George 
		   Washington and... George 
		   Washington? 


   Steve drops two one-dollar bills.  The Bouncer doesn't 
   move. 


					  DOUG 
		   Let's not forget the other boy in 
		   the band, Mr. Hamilton.  He's a 
		   little lonely, wants to join his 
		   buddies. 


   DOUG holds out a ten.  He waves it up and down, sideways, 
   drops it, but the Bouncer still doesn't respond. 


					  STEVE 
		   Wait up, look what we got here... 


   Steve reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change, 
   starts dropping coins. 


					  STEVE 
		   Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson, 
		   Lincoln... 


					  DOUG 
		   ...Roosevelt, Roosevelt, 
		   Roosevelt, Roosevelt, and a 
		   commemorative coin -- '84 
		   Olympics -- what a proud chapter 
		   in Angelino history. 


   The Bouncer looks down and turns his clipboard over, 
   dropping all the money to the ground.  OFF guys' 
   reaction... 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK VAN - LATER 


   The van stops and starts as they look out the window. 


					  DOUG 
		   There's one! 


   Steve stops.  They look out. 


					  STEVE 
		   That's not an A.T.M.  That's where 
		   you drop off your videos. 


					  DOUG 
		   Wait, there's one! 


   Steve stops short.  They look out.

   EXT. VAN - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   We see a yellow FERRARI BARREL into the back of the 
   flower van.

   The guys are thrown forward.  All the plants are thrown 
   on top of them.

   EXT. VAN - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Richard Grieco is driving the other car, BLONDE MODEL 
   with him. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Oh, shit!  The car. 


					  BLONDE MODEL 
		   Car?  What about me? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   No, this car is illegal.  All I 
		   need is a police report. 


					  BLONDE 
		   What do you mean? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   It's a racing car.  I imported it 
		   illegally. 


   The guys slowly get out of their van, dazed, dragging 
   plants as they get out. 


					  STEVE 
		   You okay? 


					  DOUG 
		   Let me see... 


   Doug slowly bops his head, feeling if there's anything 
   loose. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Ah, great.  They're starting in 
		   with the neck injuries.  I'm 
		   screwed. 


   Both guys check if their heads still work.  Grieco comes 
   over. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Hey, sorry about your car. 


					  DOUG 
		   No way.  Richard Grieco! 


					  STEVE 
		   Remember, we saw you last night? 


   Grieco nods, unsure, but agreeable. 


					  DOUG 
				(To Richard) 
		   Like Walt Disney says, my man, 
		   'It's a small world after it all.' 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   So, are you guys alright? 


					  STEVE 
		   My neck hurts. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
				(re:  cars) 
		   Right, so, what do you want to do? 


					  DOUG 
		   We were just going to the Roxbury 
		   again. 


					  STEVE 
		   But we couldn't get in. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Hey, you guys want me to get you 
		   in the Roxbury? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Yeah! 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Great.  Follow me. 


   Grieco goes back to his car. 


					  STEVE 
		   This is amazing. 


					  DOUG 
		   See?  It all comes from within. 
		   And he felt it.  Because he's an 
		   actor and he's very sensitive. 


   The guys get back in the van. 


   INT. VAN 


					  DOUG 
		   Put in 'D' and blast me. 


   Steve shoots Binaca spray into Doug's mouth and shifts. 


   GRIECO'S CAR (MOVING) 


   Grieco is driving. 




					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   We got to make a stop at the Roxbury. 


					  BLONDE MODEL 
		   What about the party? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   I don't want a lawsuit, okay? 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. ROXBURY - LATER 


   Richard Grieco walks with the Blonde Model, Steve and 
   Doug trailing behind, walking past a huge line of club 
   goers.  Steve starts breathing heavy -- he's nervous. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, keep it together.  Think 
		   F-R-A. Focus, rhythm, attitude. 


					  STEVE 
		   Got it... Fra. 


   They all reach the entrance. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Mr. Grieco.  Nice to see you. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   I got two. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Bouncer) 
		   That's right.  We're with Richard 
		   Grieco. 


					  STEVE 
				(to line of people) 
		   That's right.  Grieco!

   Red velvet curtains.  Steve and Doug push through the 
   curtains and are stunned. 


   STEVE AND DOUG'S POV 


   Beautiful, sexy, expensively dressed people mill around. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh my God, Doug, this is the most 
		   amazing place I've ever been. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Hey guys!  This is the coat room. 
		   The club's in here. 


   The guys follow Grieco. 


   INT. DANCE CLUB - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   The guys enter with Grieco.  MUSIC BLASTING. Long, 
   crowded bar, odd-shaped velvet couches, model types are 
   Velcroed to the walls, huge crowded dance floor.  This is 
   it. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
				(stunned) 
		   ...Sweet. 


    The guys follow Grieco, greeting passing women. 


					  DOUG 
		   Whats' up? 


					  STEVE 
		   What's up?... 
				(faster) 
		   What's up, what's up, whats' up, 
		   what's up, what's up... 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve!  Get a hold of yourself. 


					  STEVE 
		   Sorry, it's hottie overload in here. 


					  DOUG 
		   Pace yourself. 


					  STEVE 
				(counting to himself) 
		   ... What's up?... two, three... 
		   What's up? 


   MR. ZADIR, the club owner, 45, Armani suit, magnanimously 
   greets them, holding a drink -- he speaks with a foreign 
   accent. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Richard, my man!  Good to see you. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Benny.  Place is kickin'. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Actually, it's jumping.  Like '21 
		   Jump Street,' right?  Ha! 
				(to Steve and Doug) 
		   My children watch the reruns on 
		   T.V. land. 
				(to Grieco) 
		   Who are your friends? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Oh, guys, this is Mr. Zadir.  He 
		   owns this place.  These are uh.. 


					  DOUG 
		   Doug Butabi. 


					  STEVE 
		   Steve Butabi. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Let me show you my V.I.P. table. 


   They follow Zadir through the crowd.  As they walk... 


					  DOUG 
				(aside to Steve) 
		   Oh my God!  The owner. 


					  STEVE 
		   I know! 


					  DOUG 
		   He's the man who pulls the 
		   strings.  The Gepetto of party. 


					  STEVE 
		   Plus, he's the owner. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sh!  Listen and learn, my friend. 


   They arrive at a table overlooking the dance floor. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(waving to someone O.S.) 
		   Yes!  I see you!  Excuse me, I 
		   have to say hello to Bob Saget. 


   Mr. Zadir exits. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   So, you guys come here a lot? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, all the time. 


					  STEVE 
		   But, we're never been inside. 


   Grieco and his date look at each other. 


					  DOUG 
				(aside) 
		   Steve, what are you saying, be 
		   cool. 
				(to Grieco) 
		   So, is Johnny Depp meeting you 
		   here or what? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   No.  So you guys look like you 
		   really know how to party. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, yeah, we never stop. 


					  STEVE 
		   We're pretty much out of control. 


   Mr. Zadir returns, shouting behind him. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(to Bob O.S.) 
		   I get it, Bob, the club is 
		   crowded, so it's a 'Full House' 
		   like your show. 
				(to Richard) 
		   He's too much. 


   Grieco and his date start to get up. 


					 RICHARD GRIECO 
		  Benny, we'll see you at the party. 
		  I'll see you guys. 


					 DOUG/STEVE 
		  See ya.  Richard Grieco! 


					 RICHARD GRIECO 
			    (To Blonde) 
		   Their necks looked alright, right? 


   Grieco and Blonde exit.  A waiter puts a bottle of 
   champagne on the table and Zadir begins to pour glasses 
   -- he's obviously had a few. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sir, I just want to say, and I mean 
		   this with the utmost sincerity, it is 
		   an honor to shoot the shit with the 
		   owner of the club of all clubs. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and we're proficient club 
		   hoppers -- so we know what we're 
		   talking about. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Thank you. 


					  DOUG 
		   I mean, we usually go this place 
		   called 'The Palace' and that place is 
		   rank.  The music is ancient. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, no celeb citings and the women 
		   are oinkers. 


					  DOUG 
		   And they let any asswad in the 
		   door.  It's the worst. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   I own that place also. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, but it's a really good 
		   location. 


					  STEVE 
		   And the drinks are reasonably 
		   priced. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   No, no.  You are right.  That's 
		   what's wrong with this club 
		   business.  One day you are hot 
		   next day you are not.  People get 
		   bored easily. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well, you know I had this great 
		   idea.  You should make this place 
		   like a tropical jungle. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, lots of silk plants and 
		   vines. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, but they're not real vines. 
		   They're bungee cords and people 
		   could like swing from one end to 
		   the other so if you left your 
		   friends at the bar, you could get 
		   back to them. 


   Mr. Zadir is half listening to them as he drinks. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and the barmaids could wear 
		   loincloths -- but tasteful.  Like 
		   the ones they wear in strip clubs. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   You could not insure bungee cords. 
		   People jumping back and forth. 
		   Too expensive. 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay.  Hit delete on that one. 
		   Doug, tell him about your street 
		   idea. 


					  DOUG 
		   I was just thinking, you know how 
		   people get bummed waiting outside 
		   to get in the club. 


   Zadir nods, listening to this one. 


					  STEVE 
		   This is good.  You're gonna love 
		   this. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well, you make the outside of the 
		   club look like the inside.  You 
		   know, you put down a rug outside 
		   and some couches and pipe out some 
		   music.  People will love it.  But, 
		   then on the inside. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, this is the good part. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... Looks like the street.  You 
		   know, you park some cars inside, a 
		   mailbox, street signs, and that 
		   way when they come in, it's like 
		   the outside is the inside and 
		   inside is the outside. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doesn't that blow your mind? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   It hurts my brain to think about 
		   it.

					  VIVICA 
				(annoyed)

   Vivica stabs out her cigarette, begins to pack up. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Wait a second.  That's that Zadir 
		   guy. 


   Vivica looks up. 


   STEVE AND DOUG AND MR. ZADIR 


   laughing and drinking champagne. 


   CAMBI and VIVICA 


					  CAMBI 
		   Too bad he's married.  He owns all

		   cleaners, that beeper service, and 
		   Mailboxes, Etc... 


					  VIVICA 
		   Who are those guys with him? 


   Cambi reaches into her purse and pulls out Money 
   magazine's richest people issue. 


					  CAMBI 
		   I can't find them, but if they're

		   worth something.

		   Great.  Let's work.

   GOTTFRIED comes over. 


					  GILBERT GOTTFRIED 
		   Oh my God!  Benny!  Benny!  Benny! 
		   Benny! 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Gilbert Gottfried, who let you in? 


					  GILBERT GOTTFRIED 
		   You have to say hello to my friend 
		   at the other table.  Not this 
		   table.  No.  No.  The other one. 
		   Looks like this table -- other 
		   people around it.  I have a friends 
		   and he needs you to say hello to 
		   him at the other table. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   You have a friend? 


					  GILBERT GOTTFRIED 
		   Oh my God!  You got me!  I didn't 
		   see it coming.  No.  It was coming 
		   but I was not able to see it. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   I better go before he explodes. 


   Gilbert and Zadir walk away. 


					  DOUG 
				(nervous) 
		   Was I too pushy?  I was too pushy. 
		   Did I speak well? 


					  STEVE 
		   You were totally articulate. 


					  DOUG 
		   Maybe he didn't like our ideas. 
		   It's hard to pitch in a night 
		   club.  You ever notice, the music 
		   is blasting in here.  We should 
		   try to get a meeting. 


   Steve starts looking off at something, mesmerized. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, Steve, what if we... 


   Doug sees what Steve is watching.  He also becomes 
   mesmerized. 


   CAMBI AND VIVICA 


   In SLOW MOTION, like two cars, the girls saunter across 
   the dance floor, toward Steve and Doug. 


   STEVE and DOUG 


   even more mesmerized. 


   CAMBI AND VIVICA 


   even closer. 


   STEVE AND DOUG 


   still staring at the girls.  The girls walk up to them. 


					  STEVE 
				(on automatic) 
		   Up what's?  You want to dance? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Yes. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, she said 'Yes.' 


					  STEVE 
		   What? 


					  DOUG 
				(amazed) 
		   Hotties want to shake it, come on. 


   DANCE FLOOR 


   Steve and Doug surround the girls and frenetically 
   gyrate, pushing into them.  The girls escape and Steve 
   and Doug end up slam dancing against each other. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hey, guys!  Over here. 


   Cambi takes Doug's hand.  Vivica grabs Steve's hand. 


   ""This is Your Night"" by AMBER starts.  The following is a 
   perfectly choreographed dance to the music. 


   The girls dance seductively, dancing toward the boys. 


   Doug and Steve, unsure what's going on, look at each 
   other. 


   Simultaneously, the girls start to mimic the girls' 
   moves. 


   The boys do some hand jive, the girls match them   perfectly. 


   They begin a variety of dips, swings and techno style 
   dances. 


   They're incredible.  The crowd watches them... 


   Doug and Steve start doing some moves together. 


   An impressed JOHN TRAVOLTA comes over to them. 


   John adds his own movements and the guys follow suit. 


   John, Steve, Doug, and the girls do a synchronized 
   dance. 


   THE MUSIC STOPS.  Crowd cheers. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Travolta) 
		   Bro, you are incredible! 


					  DOUG 
		   Seriously, unbelievable stuff out 
		   there.  So, you want to hang out? 


					 JOHN TRAVOLTA 
		   No. 


   Travolta starts to exit. 


					  STEVE 
		   Alright, catch you later then. 


					 JOHN TRAVOLTA 
		   I don't think so.

   EXT. LAUREL CANYON  -- LATER 


   Mr. Zadir's black limo is driving. 


   INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir, Vivica and Cambi are inside. 
   Zadir pops open a bottle of Dom Perignon and starts 
   pouring. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Wow, 1980, good year! 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, '80 was an excellent year. 
		   Devo had a big hit that year. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and 'Joanie loves Chachie' 
		   started that year. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was just a cheap spinoff. 


					  STEVE 
		   That was a spinoff? 


					  DOUG 
		   Of course, those characters 
		   originated on 'Happy Days.' 


					  STEVE 
		   I did not know that. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Sure, 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' But, 
		   does Chachi give a Fuck about Joanie? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Cambi makes a good point.  But 
		   tonight we should have fun, not dwell 
		   on Scott Baio. 


					  STEVE 
				(drinking) 
		   Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dom Perignon's good but you know what 
		   really makes a party -- Redi Whip. 


					  STEVE 
		   But not like when you put it on 
		   stuff.  It's when you're half 
		   pressing on that little white nozzle 
		   and like before it comes out, you 
		   suck on it, and it's really fun. 


					  CAMBI 
		   You mean like nitrous oxide? 
		   Whippets? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
				(taken aback) 
		   ... No! 


					  DOUG 
				(dumbfounded) 
		   Tscha!  What is that? 


   Mr. Zadir lowers the panel between the driver and the 
   rear. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(to driver) 
		   Dooey!  We must stop and get Redi 
		   Whip! 


   DOOEY, 35, black suit and tie, looks in a rearview mirror 
   . 


					  DOOEY 
		   Yes, sir. 


   Zadir raises the panel. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Dooey) 
		   But it has to be Redi Whip in a can! 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Wait, he can't hear you. 


   Zaidir lowers the panel, nods to Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   I was just saying it has to be 
		   Redi Whip in a can. 
  


					  DOOEY 
				(annoyed) 
		   Right. 


   Zadir raises the panel. 


					  DOUG 
		   He really can't hear us? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dooey, tell your mother I had a 
		   really good time last night! 


					  STEVE 
		   And your father! 


					  DOUG 
		   What? 


					  STEVE 
		   I mean your sister! 


					  DOUG 
		   Good one. 


   The guys high five.  Cambi and Vivica exchange looks of 
   disbelief.  Dooey lowers the panel. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Mr. Zadir, I'm pulling over here 
		   to get whipped cream.

   EXT. 7-11- CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Dooey pulls over and gets out.  Doug looks out the 
   window. 


   DOUG'S POV 


   He watches Dooey talking to the cash register person. 


					  DOUG 
		   I'll be right back. 


   Doug gets out. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. 7-11- CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Dooey hands the cash register person a credit card, who 
   swipes it.  Doug rushes in. 


					  DOUG 
		   I'll take care of it. 


   Doug grabs the phone. 


					  DOUG 
		   Operator 238, please... What's up? 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CREDIT CARD CENTER - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   It's the same Switchboard Operator he talked to at the 
   store.  The following conversation is INTERCUT... 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
				(resigned) 
		   Hello, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
		   Guess where we went tonight? 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Let me see, the 7-11 on Ventura? 


					  DOUG 
		   No, I mean, before this, you sly 
		   little credit vixen. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Doug! 


					  DOUG 
		   The Roxbury with Richard Grieco 
		   and Bob Saget.  You gotta come out 
		   sometime. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   I would.  But then there'd be no 
		   one to approve all the money you 
		   spend. 


					  DOUG 
		   You're always thinking of me. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   The card's good.  'Bye, Doug. 


   She hangs up.  Doug hands the phone back. 


					  DOUG 
		   She approved. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. MANSION - LATER 


   Modern style house.  Lights dot a gravel driveway that 
   leads to the entrance.  The limo drives up. 


					  STEVE (V.O.) 
		   Sweet ass cottage, Mr. Zadir. 


   EXT. BACK YARD OF MANSION 


   THERE'S A PARTY IN FULL SWING.  Spice Girls are   performing.  A pool with a waterfall is the center of the party.  People are dancing, drinking, swimming, etc. 


   PATIO DOOR 


   opens.  Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir and the girls enter. 


					  DOUG 
		   Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed. 
		   For a guy who owns sleazy night 
		   clubs, the decor in your house is quite 
		   tasteful. 


					  STEVE 
		   Good one. 


   The guys nod to each other, proud of their compliment. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Excuse us, we're going to the 
		   ladies' room. 


   The girls walk off.  Mr. Zadir notices something. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Anna Nicole!  Put something on! 
		   You are making us sick! 


   Mr. Zadir walks away. 


					  DOUG 
		   Do you feel it, Steve?  We are 
		   finally experiencing the party 
		   lifestyle to the fullest degree. 
		   Let's mingle. 


   They walk over to a Fabio type MODEL GUY. 


					  DOUG 
		   How's it hanging?  You want to 
		   mingle? 


					  STEVE 
		   Cool party, huh? 


					  MODEL GUY 
			    (who the hell are 
				these guys) 
		   ... I guess. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, I'd say it's kicking into 
		   gear right about... 


   Steve and Doug pause a moment.  Model Guy looks at each 
   of them. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... now. 
		   


					  DOUG 
		   So, what do you do? 


					  MODEL GUY 
		   I'm a model. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, right.  So are we. 


					  STEVE 
		   It's a hard job. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, you know, like you got to 
		   stand still all the time and uh... 


					  STEVE 
				(racking his brain) 
		   ... Standing still.  Standing 
		   still is really hard.  My foot 
		   cramps sometimes. 


					  MODEL GUY 
		   I know what you mean.  What agency 
		   you with?  Elite, Ford? 


					  STEVE 
		   Uh huh. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Model) 
		   So, do you like mingling? 


					  MODEL GUY 
		   Excuse me. 


   The Model Guy walks away. 


					  STEVE 
		   Nice guy. 


					  DOUG 
				(off at Model Guy) 
		   See you on the shoot! 


   As they start eating their pasta primavera again, a NAKED 
   WOMAN emerges from the pool and walks directly towards 
   them.  Steve and Doug forget how to chew and stand, 
   stunned. 


					  NAKED WOMAN 
		   Can you pass me a towel, please? 


   They talk directly to her breasts, trying to be 
   nonchalant, but answering questions she hasn't asked. 


					  STEVE 
		   Good.  How are you? 


					  DOUG 
		   ... about eight o'clock, eight 
		   fifteen. 


					  NAKED WOMAN 
		   They're right behind you.  Can you 
		   just reach over? 


					  STEVE 
		   Thanks.  All the time. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sagittarius. 


					  STEVE 
		   BMW. 


					  DOUG 
		   Right off Sunset. 


					  STEVE 
		   Vanilla mostly. 


   She shoves by them and exits.  Mr. Zadir comes over. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Look at this, I have the Spice 
		   Girls, yet nobody is dancing. 


   The guys snap out of it. 


					  DOUG 
		   With all due party-throwing 
		   respect, you know what the problem 
		   is, Mr. Zadir?  This pool is 
		   taking up all the prime dancing 
		   real estate. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, you know, if there were a big 
		   piece of glass you could put over the 
		   pool, you could use it as a dance 
		   floor.  And it would be really sweet 
		   because people would feel like they 
		   were dancing on water. 


					  DOUG 
		   And you could put fish in the water 
		   and it would be like the ocean. 


					  STEVE 
		   Or, Doug, you know what would be 
		   another amazing idea?  You could have 
		   a special room for people who want to 
		   dance naked. 


					  DOUG 
		   Plus, then you could have a room next 
		   to that room with a one-way mirror so 
		   other people could watch them. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(calming them down) 
		   Boys, boys, please let's not talk 
		   business.  We'll schedule a meeting 
		   for this. 


   Guys silently/joyously high five their meeting.  Cambi, 
   Vivica enter. 


					  CAMBI 
		   There you are. 


					  VIVICA 
		   We got scared. 


					  DOUG 
				(protective) 
		   Of who?  We'll kick his ass. 


					  CAMBI 
		   No, we got scared someone stole 
		   you away from us. 


   Doug and Steve ponder the meaning of this statement for a 
   beat, having rarely heard a compliment. 


					  DOUG 
				(realizes it's a 
				 compliment) 
		   Oh... 
				(to Steve) 
		   Like some other girls would steal 
		   us away. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, right... Oh! 


					  CAMBI 
		   Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we 
		   borrowed them for a while? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Yes... 


   They all look at him. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   ... No! 
				(laughs) 
		   Got you! 


					  DOUG 
		   Good one, Mr. Zadir. 


					  STEVE 
		   He totally got me. 


					  DOUG 
		   Mr. Zadir, let me just say that 
		   you, sir, are a load and a half. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(laughing) 
		   Thank you, Doug! 


   The guys and girls exit.   
CUT TO: 


   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER 


   The guys are entertaining the girls with their killer 
   impression of Hall & Oates. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
				(singing) 
		   ... Oh, oh, here she comes... 


   The guys do a ""here she comes"" step. 


					  STEVE 
		   Watch out, boy, she'll chew you 
		   up. 


   Doug chews. 


					  STEVE 
		   Whoa, here she comes... 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   She's a maneater! 


   The girls look blankly at them.  The guys stop. 


					  DOUG 
		   Guess who that was? 


					  VIVICA 
		   I have no idea. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well, I was supposed to have a 
		   moustache. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Sonny and Cher? 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay, we'll give you another hint. 


   The guys get into their Hall and Oates positions. 


					  STEVE 
				(singing) 
		   She's a rich girl. 


					  DOUG 
				(singing) 
		   And she's going to go far 'cause 
		   she knows it doesn't matter 
		   anyway. 


   Cambi stands. 


					  CAMBI 
				(shutting them up) 
		   Guys, guys!  I have an idea.  You 
		   want to have some fun? 


					  DOUG 
		   Sure, fun is our last name. 


					  STEVE 
		   Plus, fun spelled backwards is 
		   'nuf.'  And you can never have 
		   'nuf' fun. 


					  VIVICA 
				(takes Steve by the hand) 
		   Great.  Let's go. 


					  STEVE 
		   Where we going? 


					  VIVICA 
		   They're staying in here.  And 
		   we're going in there. 


   Vivica pulls Steve into an adjoining guest bedroom. 


					  DOUG 
				(as the door shuts) 
		   Steve! 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug! 


   INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Vivica sits on the bed.  Steve awkwardly stands by the 
   door. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Nice room. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, it's great. 
				(yelling at door) 
		   Doug, you should check out this 
		   room! 


					  VIVICA 
		   I think he's busy. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm just a big believer in 
		   sharing. 


   Vivica sensually lies back on the bed, staring at Steve. 
   Steve is uncomfortable, starts walking around. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Steve, why don't you come over 
		   here? 


   Vivica pats the bed a few times, inviting him over. 
   Steve watches.  Thinks.  Then goes over to the bed and 
   also pats it a few times, turning it into a drum solo. 


					  VIVICA 
				(stopping him) 
		   Steve! 


   Steve stops, looks at her. 


					  STEVE 
		   Viv, you know what I heard when I 
		   first met you? 


					  VIVICA 
		   What? 


   Steve starts making a very loud inappropriate shrill 
   ambulance siren sound -- over and over. 


					  VIVICA 
		   What are you doing? 


   Steve stops. 


					  STEVE 
		   That's an ambulance.  Coming to 
		   take me away because the sight of 
		   you just stopped my heart. 


   Steve is very proud of his comment, and makes another 
   siren sound.

   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug is sitting next to Cambi, trying to think of 
   something to say. 


					  DOUG 
				(trying to be suave) 
		   So, Cambi, can I ask you 
		   something?  Do you like 
		   blueberries or strawberries? 


					  MR. CAMBI 
		   Why? 


					  DOUG 
		   I want to know what type of 
		   pancakes to order you in the 
		   morning. 


   He looks proud of his line as we begin to hear Steve O.S. 
   -- from the next room -- making more SIREN SOUNDS, over 
   and over. 


					  DOUG 
		   You know, I was wondering... 
				(snaps, annoyed at 
				 siren sound) 
		   Steve! 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
				(stops siren sound) 
		   ... Sorry! 


					  DOUG 
		   I was wondering... 


   Doug starts looking at Cambi's shirt label. 


					  CAMBI 
		   What are you doing? 


					  DOUG 
		   Checking your label.  Just as I 
		   thought.  Made in heaven. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Doug, you've gotten past the 
		   opening line. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, is that a mirror in your 
		   pocket? 


					  CAMBI 
		   What? 


					  DOUG 
		   'Cause I can see myself in your 
		   pants. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hey, Doug, if I said you had a

   Steve and Vivica sitting on the bed.

   Vivica is bored.

					  DOUG 
		   What?  Oh my God.  That is 
		   hilarious.  That is so hilarious! 
				(yelling at the door) 
		   Steve, did you hear that? 
				(to Cambi) 
		   You don't even know how funny that 
		   is.  You are funny.  You don't

   Cambi pounces on Doug with a kiss.

   INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Vivica is inches away from Steve's mouth. 


					  STEVE 
		   Vivica, I've been thinking.  Our 
		   relationship is really going 
		   strong now.  We've had some great 
		   times together that I'll never 
		   forget.  Remember when I saw you 
		   at the pool? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Yeah? 


					  STEVE 
		   So, I was just remembering back. 
				(sighs) 
		   You know, an open dialogue is an 
		   essential element to any 
		   successful long term relationship. 
		   I think we have something special 
		   going on here and I don't want to 
		   move too fast. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Is this your first time? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yes.  Isn't it yours? 


   Vivica smiles and pounces on Steve, knocking him OUT OF 
   FRAME.

   INT. MANSION HALLWAY - LATER 


   The bedroom doors simultaneously open.  Doug and Steve 
   excited, run into the hallway.

		   Oh my God!  Did you just?  'Cause 
		   I just! 


					  STEVE 
		   This is unbelievable! 


					  DOUG 
		   This is historical!  This what 
		   it's all about!  Up Top! 


   They high-five.  Doug suddenly catches himself,  changes 
   back to cool attitude -- Steve follows. 


					  DOUG 
		   Not that it hasn't happened before. 


					  STEVE 
		   Of course not. 


					  DOUG 
		   I mean it was alright. 


					  STEVE 
		   The usual. 


   They stand there, posing cool, but awkward for a beat. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm gonna go back in the --

		   Me, too.  I'll see you later. 


   They run back in the bedrooms.

					  DOUG 
		   Hey, Steve? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was great. 


					  STEVE 
		   I know.  Are we A club people now? 


   Doug looks at him -- then to answer, he pulls out a small 
   piece of paper, shows it to Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   You got a number!  Wooo! 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Woo!  We got a number! 


   They jump up and down, embracing, happy as hell.

					  DOUG 
		   Where have you been?  We've got to 
		   get ready for our business meeting

					   STEVE 
		    I got some great new supplies for

   Steve starts pulling items out of the bag,  Doug doesn't

		   'While you were out' pads -- for 
		   while you are out.  Scotch tape, 
		   in case the Post Its lose their 
		   adhesive-osity.  And mugs with our 
		   names on them.  Yours says, 
		   'Doug.' 


   Doug turns around. 


					  DOUG 
		   Okay, here's what we're gonna do. 


					  STEVE 
				(interrupting) 
		   Did you call Mr. Zadir? 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, before you talk to a man like 
		   Mr. Zadir, you have to have a fully 
		   developed plan of attack.  You have 
		   to have all your ducks in row. 


					  STEVE 
		   I didn't know to get ducks. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's an expression. 


					  STEVE 
		   So, we're going back to the dance 
		   club idea? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah.  Now you set up the office. 
		   I'm gonna call some real estate 
		   people to talk about locations. 
		   At that point, I'd like to 
		   schedule a meeting.  Can you do 
		   tweleve thirty. 


   Doug checks his Filofax.  Steve unwraps a new Filofax and 
   starts looking through it. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm clear. 


					  DOUG 
		   Great.  Be prepared to discuss 
		   possible club names and themes. 


					  STEVE 
		   What about music? 


					  DOUG 
		   We'll have to schedule another 
		   meeting for that.  Hey, you know 
		   what?  Maybe we should have a pre- 
		   meeting to brainstorm before our 
		   scheduled meeting. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah.  That way we won't look like 
		   idiots at our meeting. 


					  DOUG 
		   Exactly.  Okay, I'm gonna roll a 
		   few calls.  We should order in. 


					  STEVE 
		   I can take care of that. 
				(to door) 
		   Ma! 


   Doug pulls out the phone, starts dialing.  Steve starts 
   organizing the desk. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, Steve? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah? 


					  DOUG 
		   I was just thinking.  Dad would 
		   really be proud of us right now. 


   They both smile.  Mrs. Butabi enters. 

  
					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Boys, your father's furious.  You 
		   were supposed to be at work an 
		   hour ago. 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright, we're gonna have to do 
		   some re-scheduling.

   INT. SILK PLANT STORE -AFTERNOON 


   Doug, behind cash register, holding clipboard, on the 
   phone.			    


					  DOUG 
		   Yes, hello, I'm interested in your 
		   sound systems.  I've heard good  
		   things about your woofers and    
		   tweeters. 
	   


   Steve walks over. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, I... 


					  DOUG 
		   I'm on a call. 


   Steve nods, knowing what to do.  He pulls a Post-It, 
   writes something down and sticks it on Doug's clipboard. 
   A LADY walks up with a small plant.  Doug puts a	""Register Closed"" sign on the counter.  The Lady leaves 
   and we FOLLOW her TO Mr. Butabi.	  


					  LADY 
		   Mr. Butabi, where is the other 
		   cash register? 


   MR. BUTABI'S POV 


   Cash register.  There are several Post-Its stuck to the 
   counter.  Steve is filling out another one. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I'll be with you in a second, Mrs. 
		   Manicotti. 


   Mr. Butabi goes over to the cash register. 


					  DOUG 
		   One second, Dad. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   It's good to see you're on a 
		   break.  I mean, after all, you've 
		   been here almost twenty minutes 
		   now and it's hard work listening 
		   to your walking man and ringing up 
		   the one customer you've had. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, I'm sensing a note of sarcasm. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   This is a very nice sign.  Except for 
		   one thing. 
				(exploding) 
		   This is the only register!  This is 
		   why I pay you -- to push a button and 
		   take the money.  Is that too much? 
		   Is there some problem I don't know 
		   about?  Did you injure your button 
		   pushing finger in a bad cell phone 
		   accident? 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, why don't you go to Rexall's 
		   Drug Store.  I think you need to 
		   purchase a bottle of chill pills. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Just when I thought I had you doing 
		   the absolute minimum, you astound me 
		   with how much less you can do. 


					  DOUG 
		   For your information, Dad, we are 
		   working our asses off. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, our week's filling up pretty 
		   quick. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, last night, Steve and I 
		   happen to have made a very 
		   important business contact. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Oh, what are you dancing the 
		   Macarena with Donald Trump? 


					  STEVE 
		   Did you want me to go the drug 
		   store to get those pills? 


					  DOUG 
		   I think we should tell him now. 
				(excited) 
		   Dad, you're gonna love this.  We're 
		   working on this club idea which could 
		   include many silk plant opportunities 
		   and guess who we thought could be our 
		   supplier? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, I need you to give me 
		   opportunities.  I feed you, I clothe 
		   you, I put a roof over your head and 
		   I pay for your little phones so you 
		   can call other idiots.  I give up on 
		   you two.  I am ashamed to call you my 
		   sons. 


					  DOUG 
		   There you go again, Dad.  You always 
		   tell us to do something with our 
		   lives and when we finally do, what 
		   happens?  You got to put us down. 
		   You never support us, you never 
		   encourage us, and you never care 
		   about what's important to us.  Right, 
		   Steve? 


					  STEVE 
		   Do you need a prescription for those 
		   pills? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   It's my own fault.  I spoil you. 
		   From now on, you are no longer 
		   allowed to go out to clubs at 
		   night. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   What? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Now enough wasting time.  Go clean 
		   up the stock room. 


					  DOUG 
		   You know what, Poppason, not only 
		   will Steve and I not clean the 
		   stock room, but we are officially 
		   out of here! 
				(to Steve) 
		   Come on. 


   Doug starts walking out. 


					  STEVE 
		   But what about the stock room? 


					  DOUG 
		   We quit! 
				(turns back to Dad) 
		   And we don't need you!  We made 
		   big contacts last night! 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, plus we met these girls, 
		   Dad, and you wouldn't believe what 
		   happened. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Dad) 
		   We're gonna make it without you. 
		   You'll see. 


   Doug exits, Steve follows him. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, I'll see tonight when you get 
		   hungry and you come home to eat my 
		   food.  And when you come crawling 
		   to me for more money! 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SILK PLANT STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug and Steve barrel out the front door and head 
   straight for the van.  Emily, in a sexy sun dress, 
   carrying two big huge oversized lightbulbs where her 
   breasts would be, steps in front of them. 


					  EMILY 
		   Hey, Steve!  Do you want to go to 
		   the beach later?  I've got my 
		   bathing suit on under this. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Emily) 
		   Not now! 


   Doug blows by Emily.  Beat.  He steps back INTO FRAME -- 
   takes a second look at the odd bulb positions -- and 
   exits again.  The guys start getting into the van. 


					  EMILY 
		   I'm not talking to you, Doug. 
		   You're an ass. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, we're experiencing a major 
		   family crisis.  I'm gonna have to 
		   take a rain check on this convo. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve!  Car! 


					  STEVE 
				(as he gets into 
				 the car) 
		   Nice bulbs, Emily. 


   Steve gets in.  They PEEL OUT. 


					  EMILY 
				(yells after them) 
		   So, you want to go out tonight? 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   The guys speed along on their way to Butabi.  Doug is 
   looking over a sheet of paper. 


					  DOUG 
		   Okay, these are the ideas we'll 
		   pitch him.  The Jungle Paradise. 


					  STEVE 
		   Killer. 


					  DOUG 
		   The Inside Out Club. 


					  STEVE 
		   Money. 


					  DOUG 
		   The Civil War. 


					  STEVE 
		   That one needs work. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah.  We'll hold off on that one. 
		   And let's not forget our ace in 
		   the hole -- The Naked Room. 


					  STEVE 
		   I think we should call it 'The 
		   Nudist Colony.' 


					  DOUG 
		  That sounds like a strip club. 
		  And this is a dance club. 


					  STEVE 
		   You're right.  We'll go with 'The 
		   Naked Room.'

   EXT. ZADIR'S MANSION 


   The silk van drives up.  Steve and Doug get out and walk 
   up to the locked gate. 


					  DOUG 
		   Zadir's gonna be excited to see 
		   us.  This is it, bro... 


   Doug presses the intercom.  They wait. 


					  STEVE 
		   This is it. 


   Doug presses the intercom buzzer again.  No response.  As 
   they wait, Steve starts to sing to himself. 


					  STEVE 
				(very softly) 
		   'This is it, make your mistakes 
		   where you are.  This is it...' 


   We realize Steve is singing ""This Is It"" by Kenny 
   Loggins.  Doug slowly joins in as they pass the time. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   '... We're going no further.' 


   The both step singing as Doug hits the buzzer again. 
   After a beat of waiting, Steve picks up the song where 
   they left off... 


					  STEVE 
				(soloing much louder) 
		   'Here!  The moment is now, no 
		   place for goodbyes...' 


   INTERCOM 


   Male voice starts singing the next lyric. 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   'And now I'm not so sure... doo 
		   doo... deep in my heart...' 


					  DOUG/STEVE/INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   This is it! 


   BACK TO SCENE 


   They stop singing. 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   You guys know 'Footloose'? 


					  DOUG 
				(running to 
				 intercom) 
		   Actually, we're here to see Mr. 
		   Zadir.  It's Steve and Doug Butabi. 


					  STEVE 
				(softly to himself) 
		   '... pick up your Sunday shoes...' 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   Mr. Zadir's not here. 


					  STEVE 
		   We were supposed to have a meeting 
		   with him about our ideas.  Like 
		   there's one where the inside is 
		   outside and there's one about a 
		   jungle and... 


					  DOUG 
				(shutting him up, 
				 covering the 
				 intercom) 
		   Steve!  Never talk concepts with 
		   the intercom. 
			    (to intercom) 
		   Can we come inside and wait for 
		   him? 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Can we leave him a message? 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   No. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Doug) 
		   Let's just forget it. 


					  DOUG 
		   Stay strong, sailor. 
				(to intercom) 
		   Do you know where we can find him? 


					 INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   He's at the office in Wilshire. 


   They jump in the car and drive off.

   We see a large engraved marble ""Zadir Industries"" sign 
   above the entrance. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. ELEVATOR - LATER 


   We see each elevator button is the name of Zadir's many 
   businesses (Zadir Dry Cleaners, Zadir Beepers, Zadir 
   Gaming & Entertainment, Zadir Real Estate, Executive 
   Suite). 


   DOUG AND STEVE 


   listen to a MUZAK VERSION of ""WHAT IS LOVE"" by Haddaway. 
   Their heads begin to bop very slowly.  A hot-looking 
   businesswoman gets on.  They guys smile politely and wait 
   patiently.  We hear a DING.  The businesswoman gets off. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, Steve, did you notice we 
		   forgot to ask her something? 


					  STEVE 
		   You mean, 'What's up?' 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah.  That's weird. 


					  STEVE 
		   Actually, it's not.  We're both 
		   involved in serious relationships 
		   now, and our ladies know they can 
		   trust us.  'Trust' being the key 
		   element in any worthwhile 
		   commitment. 


					  DOUG 
		   Why go out for burgers when we've 
		   got steak at home? 


					  STEVE 
		   You're right.  We should get lunch 
		   after this. 


   INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES - RECEPTION - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Elevator doors open.  Doug and Steve exit onto a very 
   modern white glass floor. 


   RECEPTION AREA 


   Doug and Steve walk over to a RECEPTIONIST. 


					  DOUG 
		   Doug and Steve Butabi for Mr. 
		   Zadir. 


					  RECEPTIONIST 
		   You're brothers? 


   Doug and Steve give each other a look.  They're tempted 
   to tell their ""brother joke."" 


					  DOUG 
		   Ma'am, thanks for the setup, but 
		   we really can't get into that 
		   right now. 


   Steve looks down the hall of offices to his left. 


   STEVE'S POV 


   At the end of the hall, Mr. Zadir and Dooey quickly walk 
   by. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, Mr. Zadir! 


   The guys run down the hall. 


					  RECEPTIONIST 
		   Hey, you can't...! 


   HALLWAY 


   The guys run past office files, they pass a Fed Ex woman. 
   Steve stops in his tracks. 


					  STEVE 
		   Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
		   but I'm in a serious relationship 
		   right now. 


   Steve immediately jumps back into full stride. 


   END OF HALLWAY 


   The guys turn a corner. 


   CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR 


   As Dooey closes the door, we see Mr. Zadir at the head of 
   a board meeting.  Zadir does not see them.  Dooey turns 
   around. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Dooey!  My very main man.  Up top! 


   The guys raise their hands to high five. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER 


   Dooey forcefully drags the guys by their shirts, through 
   the door and towards the elevators. 


					  STEVE 
				(sincere) 
		   So, Dooey, how's everything goin'? 


					  DOUG 
		   Ragin' party last night. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Yeah, is that what my mother said 
		   to you... 
			    (indicating he heard 
				them in the limo) 
		   ... or was it my father? 


   Dooey drops the guys next to the elevator, presses the 
   down button, begins to walk away. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, Zadir wants to have this 
		   meeting by the elevators? 


   Dooey stops and slowly turns around. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Those Redi Whip cans were a big hit 
		   last night.  I was out till four in 
		   the morning trying to find more. 


					  STEVE 
				(impressed) 
		   From dusk 'til dawn -- you, sir, are 
		   a party animal. 


					  DOOEY 
				(threatening) 
		   Don't go near Mr. Zadir.  He was 
		   drunk last night and he doesn't even 
		   remember you.  You think you're the 
		   first losers he's picked up that I've 
		   had to get rid of come Monday? 


					  DOUG 
		   Uh... Doo-man, I don't know if I'm 
		   reading my diss-meter correctly. 
		   Because are we being blown off. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Just stay away if you know what's 
		   good for you. 


   Dooey walks away.  The guys are in shock for a beat. 
   Suddenly, Doug bolts full speed past Dooey and back into 
   the office.  Dooey follows. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR 


   Doug runs up to the shut door and starts banging.  No 
   response.  He notices, to the left, a glass window 
   looking into the conference room. 


   DOUG'S POV 


   Zadir looks up -- we can't tell if he sees Doug or not. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


   Suddenly, two burly security guys pull Doug away. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. ZADIR'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATER 


   The security guys physically push the guys out the 
   building. 


					  STEVE 
				(to security) 
		   Alright, so we'll see you guys later. 


   The security guys, unfazed, walk back in. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. VAN - LATER 


   The guys get in and sit there, depressed.  After a 
   beat... 


					  STEVE 
		   What do you want to do? 


					  DOUG 
		   I can't talk to you right now. 
		   Give me a second. 


					  STEVE 
		   Maybe we should just go back to 
		   work. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, and maybe we should just go 
		   to college and not put gel in our 
		   hair and starts wearing blue jeans. 
		   Let's do that, Steve! 


					  STEVE 
		   ... Sorry. 


   Steve suddenly gets an idea and reaches into the glove 
   compartment.  He pulls out the piece of paper with 
   Cambi's number on it -- we see he's put it in a small 
   lucite frame. 


					  STEVE 
			    (trying to cheer 
				 Doug up) 
		   Cambi's number. 


   Doug looks up at the number, starts to come out of his 
   funk. 


					  STEVE 
		   We had a sweet time last night, 
		   didn't we? 


					 DOUG 
		   Sweet ass time. 


					  STEVE 
		   Diabetic.  I could see doing that 
		   again, maybe even a couple a times 
		   a week, right? 


					  DOUG 
		   The ladies await, my friend.  Cell! 


   Steve slaps a cellular phone into Doug's hand.  Steve 
   looks down, shifts again, they pull out.

   INT. MONDRIAN SKYBAR - LATER 


   Cambi and Vivica are standing by the bar, talking to

   We hear a PAGER GO OFF in Cambi's bag.  She checks the 
   beeper.

				(frustrated) 
		   Steve, you have to hit the pound 
		   sign or it doesn't go through. 
				(sighs) 
		   Maybe their phones aren't working. 


					  STEVE 
		   Try putting in our number and then

		   Good. 


					  DOUG 
		   Long-term relationship good? 


					  STEVE 
		   It's totally committed.  You know,

		   well, it really makes you realize 
		   how much your woman means to you.

  INT. SKYBAR - DAY 


  Steve and Doug enter and are hit with the unwelcome sight 
  of their girls flirting with the businessmen.  They strut

					  DOUG 
		   These guys bothering you? 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hi, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
				(to businessmen) 
		   You guys messing with our women. 


					  JAPANESE GUYS 
				(in Japanese) 
		   What's up? 


					  DOUG 
		   You want to mix it up?  Come on! 
		   Take me on.  I'm insane.  You 
		   don't know what you're dealing with. 


   The businessmen look at them strangely. 


					  STEVE 
		   Vivica, I'm feeling a little 
		   vulnerable here.  I thought we had 
		   an understanding.  And I can't 
		   believe you're willing to just 
		   throw away everything we've been 
		   to each other? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Doug, Steve, this is Akiro and 
		   Toronaga... they're my cousins. 


   Steve is relieved, Doug is mistrustful. 


					  STEVE 
			   (holding out hand to 
			    shake) 
		   Oh!  Well, it's about time that we 
		   met the family. 


					  DOUG 
			    (pulling to Steve's 
				hand back) 
		   Come on!  What do you think, we're 
		   stupid?  How can they be your 
		   cousins? 


					  VIVICA 
			    (like talking to a 
				child) 
		   Well, his mother and my mother are 
		   sisters and that makes us cousins. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... Oh.  Okay. 


					  CAMBI 
			    (to Akiro and 
				 Toronaga) 
		   Would you excuse us a second? 


					  DOUG

  Cambi and Vivica, Steve, Doug assemble near the Silk van. 


					  CAMBI 
		   So, did you guys have as good a 
		   time last night as we did? 


					  STEVE 
		   I had a great time, Vivica.  In 
		   fact, I think we've reached the 
		   point where I can comfortably call 
		   you 'Viv' and leave out the 'Ica.' 


					  DOUG 
		   So, you guys want to hang out or 
		   see a movie or do what we did last 
		   night... or eat or... just do what 
		   we did last night or hang out, eat 
		   and then do what we did last night

		   what we did last night. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Sounds good. 


   Cambi gives Doug a kiss.  He melts, then quickly tries to 
   act cool.  Vivica affectionately holds Steve's arm. 


					  STEVE 
		   Viv, I'm glad our relationship is 
		   strong enough to withstand the 
		   hard times -- like when were 
		   just in the bar -- I also think 
		   we're not just projecting onto one 
		   another but dealing with the 
		   reality of who we are.  And most 
		   important, we know how to listen. 


					  VIVICA 
		   What? 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hey, you boys want to go somewhere 
		   quiet? 


   The girls look at them seductively. 


					  DOUG 
		   No... 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Yes! 


					  STEVE 
				(in reference to 
				 joke) 
		   It's gold.  I'm telling you. 


   The guys high five and laugh -- they walk to the van. 
   Doug opens the passenger door. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ladies, have your boarding passes 
		   ready. 


   Cambi and Vivica just stand there. 


					  CAMBI 
		   What are you doing? 


					  STEVE 
		   Aisle or window seat?  I'm sorry, 
		   ma'am, you're gonna have to check 
		   that bag... The movie on this 
		   flight will be uh... I don't know. 
		   I can't think of any more. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Where's your car? 


					  DOUG 
		   Our dad got mad and took it away. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Your dad? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, we used to work for him, but 
		   we quit today so actually we're 
		   unemployed. 


					  VIVICA 
		   You're not in business with Mr. 
		   Zadir? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yes, we are.  But, not now.  We 
		   just met him last night.  But, we 
		   will be.  So, no, but, yes. 


					  STEVE 
		   Especially, if we ever get to see 
		   him again. 


   The girls digest this for a beat.  Cambi signals to 
   Vivica and they both start walking back to the bar.  The 
   guys, confused, run up to them. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, we were just kidding about 
		   those boarding passes.  You can 
		   get in. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Get away from us. 


					  DOUG 
		   What's going on? 


					  CAMBI 
		   You guys are a big waste of time. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... Como what? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Steve, you're a jerkoff. 


					  STEVE 
		   Well, I'm glad you shared that 
		   with me.  That's a big step for 
		   the both of us. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Guys, consider what we did with 
		   you last night a favor.  Now do us 
		   a favor and never talk to us 
		   again! 


					  DOUG 
		   What did we do wrong?  We'll 
		   change. 


					  VIVICA 
		   No, you can't change.  You and 
		   your brother are ugly pathetic 
		   losers. 
				(to Cambi) 
		   That's the problem with 
		   nightclubs.  Poor schmucks look 
		   just the same as rich schmucks. 


   The girls walk back to the bar.  The guys watch them go. 


					  CAMBI 
				(as they walk) 
		   I can't believe we actually had 
		   sex with those asswads.  I hope 
		   the nips are still at the bar. 


   The girls disappear into the bar.  The guys stand in 
   shock, trying to absorb the ultimate rejection.

   EXT. FREEWAY - LATER 


   Slow-moving congestion.  We see the Silk van driving in 
   the middle of it. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK VAN - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Doug and Steve sit in silence for a while. 


					  STEVE 
				(trying to cheer 
				 him up) 
		   Hey, Doug, I think some of the 
		   plants are beginning to wilt... 
		   no, I'm just kidding.  They're 
		   made out of silk. 


   Doug doesn't respond. 


					  STEVE 
				(singing quietly) 
		   ... 'This is it.' 


					  DOUG 
				(cutting him off) 
		   Steve!  This is the worst day of 
		   my life.  So, if you don't mind, I 
		   really don't want to hear you talk 
		   right now. 


					  STEVE 
		   Well, it hasn't been the Super Bowl 
		   for me either... 
				(mumbling) 
		   ... just trying to get you to talk. 


					  DOUG 
				(blowing up) 
		   Talk?!  You want me to talk, Steve?! 
		   I'll talk.  Blah-blah-blah, talk, 
		   talk, talk!  I'm talking!  You feel 
		   better now?!  Talk! 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't really know how to respond to 
		   that. 


					  DOUG 
				(ripping into him) 
		   Oh, big surprise, Steve.  You don't 
		   know how to do something.  You don't 
		   know how to work the clubs, you don't 
		   know how to talk to women.  The only 
		   thing you know how to do is ask me 
		   how to do everything! 


					  STEVE 
		   But, I -- 


					  DOUG 
		   That's why everthing's gone 
		   wrong... 'cause you're holding me 
		   back. 
		   


					  DOUG (CONT'D) 
		   You're so needy all the time. 
		   You're like this thing tied to my 
		   leg, like this... dragging 
		   thing... 


					  STEVE 
		   A lead weight? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yes, a lead weight. 
				(sincere) 
		   Thanks. 
				(back to angry) 
		   And I am not letting you drag me 
		   down anymore. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... You know, can't blame me for 
		   what happened.  Today was a series 
		   of random events gone awry. 


					  DOUG 
		   Maybe events wouldn't go awry if I 
		   had someone with a brain sitting 
		   next to me. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, yeah.  Well, maybe I'd have 
		   better events if I was with 
		   someone with a higher level of 
		   looks and taller. 


   Doug, in shock, starts to hyperventilate from anger. 


					  DOUG 
				(breathing heavily) 
		   I'm tall enough to kick your ass. 


					  STEVE 
				(cupping his ear) 
		   Did you say something?  It's hard 
		   to hear things that low down to 
		   the ground. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well hear this.  Consider me your 
		   ex-brother. 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't care. 


					  DOUG 
		   You care about this? 


   Doug fakes throwing a punch -- Steve flinches.  Steve 
   fake punches -- Doug flinches. 


					  DOUG 
		   You want the real thing?! 


					  STEVE 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Then stop talking to me. 


					  STEVE 
		   My pleasure. 


   They continue along in silence, both looking miserable.

   EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - NEXT MORNING 


   We see the Silk van parked in front of the house. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Steve lies on his bed looking out the window.  Doug's 
   bed is empty. 


   STEVE'S POV 


   We see Doug carrying all his clothes into the Butabi 
   guest cottage. 


   STEVE 


   is sad.  Gets up, walks to Doug's desk and throws all the 
   Post-its and business supplies in the trash. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BUTABI GUEST COTTAGE - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   A simple studio.  Doug dumps his belongings on the bed -- 
   bottles of hair gel, colognes, aftershaves, etc.  He 
   picks up Cambi's framed number, yanks it out of the frame 
   and rips it to shreds.  Then he sits back on the bed, 
   picks up remote and turns the TELEVISION ON. 


   TELEVISION SCREEN 


   Oddly enough, it's a rerun of ""21 Jump Street"" featuring 
   Richard Greico. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  DOUG 
		   Lies!  All lies! 


   Doug shuts it OFF. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK PLANT STORE - DAY 


   A depressed Steve is emotionally selling a plant to a 
   female customer. 


					  STEVE 
				(sadly) 
		   That's right, ma'am.  It's silk. 
		   It'll always be in bloom.  It'll 
		   never change.  It'll never die. 
		   It'll never yell at you and call 
		   you a 'loser.'  It'll always be in 
		   your room where you left it, not 
		   suddenly move out into the guest 
		   house. 


   The customer is crying.  Mr. Butabi walks over, pulls 
   Steve aside. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   What are you doing?  All the 
		   customers are depressed. 


					  STEVE 
				(looking over at 
				 empty register) 
		   I'm just used to seeing Doug at 
		   the register.  I miss him. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   But he's only in the guest house. 
		   It's ten feet away.  It's like a 
		   mansion in there. 


					  STEVE 
		   There's no cable. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   There is Cinemax. 


					  STEVE 
				(crying) 
		   But, there's no H.B.O. 


   Steve walks off, upset. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CRUNCH GYM - DAY 


   Emily, in skin-tight shiny body suit, is exercising on 
   the Peck Deck portion of a Nautilus machine -- filled 
   with people.  She finishes her last repetitions. 


					  EMILY 
		   Nine... ten. 


   She stops.  Then looks in a little workout book entitled 
   Diet to Get Steve. 


					  EMILY 
		   Okay.  One more set.  Add ten 
		   pounds. 


   She bends down and pulls the metal pin out of the 
   weights.  The person next to her, using the lat bar, goes 
   flying up. 


					  EMILY 
		   Whoops.  Sorry.  Wrong pin. 


   EMILY'S POV 


   Steve is doing sit-ups on a slant board.  Craig spots 
   him. 


   CRAIG AND STEVE 


   Steve is straining, in mid-crunch.  Craig is eating a 
   Power Bar. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Not the neck -- the stomach.  Not 
		   the thighs -- the stomach.  Not 
		   the shoulders - the... Oh my God! 


					  STEVE 
		   What? 


					  CRAIG 
		   Ab citing!  Six pack in full 
		   effect. 


					  STEVE 
		   Where! 


   Steve rushes to mirror, holds up his shirt.  Craig 
   points. 


					  CRAIG 
		   There she cuts. 


   Emily enters. 


					  EMILY 
		   Hi, Steve.  Is that an ab? 


					  CRAIG 
				(noticing Emily's 
				 body) 
		   Toned and tight, Emily.  Want to 
		   power up? 


   He offers her a bite of his bar.  She ignores him.  Craig 
   stands there chewing a Power Bar and drinking an ""Ultra 
   Fuel"" while they talk. 


					  EMILY 
		   I heard about your brother. 


					  STEVE 
				(avoiding eye contact) 
		   What'd you hear about him? 


					  EMILY 
		   Your father said you and him quit, 
		   then you had a fight, then you 
		   came crawling back to work like he 
		   said you would and how your 
		   brother didn't. 


					  STEVE 
		   So? 


					  EMILY 
		   So, when are we going out? 


					  CRAIG 
		   I know a place with good spinach 
		   wraps? 


					  STEVE 
		   Look, Emily, I know you've had 
		   your heart set on this a long 
		   time, but, the truth is we're from 
		   two different worlds.  I mean, I'm 
		   a rebel... and you're kind of the 
		   sweet girl next door type. 


					  EMILY 
		   Steve, I work next door.  It's not 
		   a type, it's a location. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know what I mean.  I don't 
		   know if you can handle a guy like 
		   me.  I'm used to more, like 
		   experienced women. 


					  EMILY 
		   Duh.  You're forgetting -- I got to 
		   college.  Translation -- drunken 
		   orgies with occasional Cliff 
		   Notes. 


					  CRAIG 
		   I know Cliff.  Weak delts. 


					  EMILY 
		   And I'm not one of those date rape 
		   crybabies. 


					  STEVE 
		   Look, it sounds good, but I'm 
		   getting over a very serious 
		   relationship right now.  It's 
		   gonna take some time to nurse 
		   my emotional wounds.  And that 
		   could take, like, until Saturday. 


					  EMILY 
		   Perfect, your dad bought us two 
		   tickets to David Copperfield, this 
		   Saturday. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'll let you know how I'm feeling. 


					  EMILY 
		   It'll be fun to see things appear, 
		   and then disappear. 


   Emily grabs his face and shoves her tongue down his 
   throat for a beat and pulls back. 


					  EMILY 
		   See ya. 


					  CRAIG 
				(watching Emily leave) 
		   Tight glutes. 
				(sincere) 
		   Steve, as a trainer.  I'm pretty 
		   perceptive about picking up body 
		   language... I think she likes you.

   SUBTITLE:  ONE WEEK LATER 


   Doug is unshaven, unkempt.  Disinterestedly flipping 
   channels.  He throws the remote away. 


					 DOUG 
		   ... Fine!  I won't watch Larry

   Gets up and exits.  We hear the VAN PEEL OUT. 


   Seperation MONTAGE BEGINS: 


							   CUT TO: 


   MONTAGE 


   A)   INT. DAVID COPPERFIELD SHOW - NIGHT 


	  David Copperfield is on stage doing a pseudo-sexy 
	  trick.  In the audience, Steve tries to subtly work 
	  his arm behind Emily.  She notices, grabs his hand, 
	  and plants it on her breast. 


							   CUT TO: 


   B)  INT. DISCO - NIGHT 


	  Doug is drunk, trying to dance with a girl.  She

	  a biker guy -- who tries to dance with him. 


							   CUT TO: 


   C)  EXT. BUTABI GUEST COTTAGE -NIGHT 


	  The dogs are dragging a dead deer across the 
	  driveway.  Suddenly, the Silk van pulls in too fast, 
	  runs over some plants and smashes over a chaise 
	  lounge chair.  The van stops and Doug, literally, 
	  falls out of the van and onto the ground.  He lies 
	  there. 


							   CUT TO: 


   D)  INT. SILK STORE DAY

   END OF MONTAGE

   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT 


   Steve and Emily are in bed -- pre-sex.  Steve is in a 
   pajama top.  Emily is in a black nightie and flipping 
   through a USC School of Business course guide.  Steve 
   kisses her neck, Emily keeps reading.  Steve reaches over 
   and puts his hand on her breast.  Emily keeps reading. 
   He pulls his hand back. 


					  EMILY 
		   Here's one -- 'Business Computer	
		   Systems.' 


					  STEVE 
				(disinterested) 
		   I'm not real good with machines. 
		   That was Doug's thing.  I'm more 
		   of a people person. 


					  EMILY 
		   Steve, a businessman has to have a 
		   knowledge of computers.  Ooo!  -- 
		   'Venture Management and Analysis.' 
		   you have to take that. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know, my dad's giving me the 
		   store anyway.  I don't really have 
		   to go back to school. 


					  EMILY 
		   One store?  Yah... and maybe 
		   we'll just have like one house and 
		   one car.  Steve, we're gonna have 
		   more than one store.  And you have 
		   to be prepared. 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't really want to go back to 
		   school.  I'll have to read. 


					  STEVE (CONT'D) 
		   And homework and teachers always 
		   asking you if you'd like to share 
		   that with the rest of the class. 


					  EMILY 
		   Don't upset me.  Unless you want 
		   to make me less horny. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, that wouldn't be good. 


					  EMILY 
				(kissing him) 
		   Look, first, we combine the 
		   stores, plants and lamps, then we 
		   can add furniture, you know 
		   recliners... 


   Emily climbs on top of him, and rubs herself against him. 


					  EMILY 
		   ... sofas and tables and... 
		   and... 


   She moans. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... chairs? 


					  EMILY 
		   Oh, yes!  Chairs and wastepaper 
		   baskets and... and... 


					  STEVE 
		   Ah!... Ottomans! 


   Emily rips Steve's pajama top off, as she rides him. 


					  EMILY 
				(progressively 
				 getting closer 
				 to orgasm) 
		   And then we'll open a second store 
		   in Orange County with dinette sets 
		   and entertainment centers, and a 
		   third in San Francisco and then 
		   we'll be bigger than Ikea, oh my 
		   God... Home Depot!  I, I, Ikeaaa! 


   Emily orgasms and slides off Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, I'm sort of feeling, you 
		   know, like we're moving too fast. 
		   You're talking like we're married. 


					  EMILY 
				(taking it as a 
				 proposal) 
		   Oh my God!  Steve!  You've made me 
		   so happy! 


   She hugs him. 


					  STEVE 
				(upset) 
		   What?  No, no.  I meant... 


   Emily quickly ducks OUT OF FRAME to perform oral sex on

		   gonna wear? 


					  DOUG 
				(dropping head to

		   Oh, God. 


					  CRAIG 
		   You got to hand it to Steve.  That 
		   Emily's the perfect woman.  Strong 
		   legs, low body fat, and a positive 
		   mental attitude.  A lady like that 
		   can really keep you on track.  Is it 
		   okay to wear black at an afternoon 
		   affair? 


					  DOUG 
		   Shut up, you idiot. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Doug, I know you and your brother 
		   are having some problems, but that 
		   is no reason to refer to my 
		   intellectual capacity in a 
		   diminutive manner. 


					  DOUG 
		   I'm sorry, Craig, but you totally 
		   Wolf Blitzerd me with the

		   Ten-Four.  Boundary set. 


					  DOUG

		   Look, did we come here for some

		   Let's do it. 


   They move out.

   The guys walk over to the back of a blonde woman. 


					 DOUG 
		   Hey, sweetness, what's up? 


   The woman turns around -- it's ELLEN DEGENERES. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, fine thing, you got it going 
		   on. 


					  ELLEN DEGENERES 
		   Thank you.  I was worried. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, you want to shake it? 


					  ELLEN DEGENERES 
		   No, I think I'll just let it sit. 


					  DOUG 
		   You sure? 


					  ELLEN DEGENERES 
		   Now that I've met you, I'm more 
		   sure than I've ever been. 


   Ellen walks away.

					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   And the hors d'oeuvers are hummus

					  MABEL 
		   Who's going to eat that?  You

   Steve is sticking a spoon on his nose.  Mr. Butabi takes

					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Okay.  A toast to Steve and Emily,

		   My brother and his wife from

					  FRED 
		   Wherever the hell that is.  I'm 
		   just kidding.  And that's not the

		   From what I understand, we got a 
		   new lamp/plant store. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   That's plant/lamp store.  Ha 
		   ha... that's a joke.  But,

		   say... what's up... Grandpa, 
		   Grandma, and those other two old 
		   people. 


   Steve sits.  Emily quickly stands. 


					  EMILY 
		   I think what Steve means, is that, 
		   we're just thrilled with the way 
		   this family is coming together. 
		   And I'd like to share with you 
		   some of our business plans for 
		   after the merger. 
				(to Grandma) 
		   Can you pass these out? 


   Emily hands out business plan folders. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I will get more wine. 


   Mr. Butabi is looking through a wine rack.  Steve enters. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we 
		   could cancel this whole thing? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, sure... 
				(turns to Doug) 
		   ... Nooo! 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, that's so funny.  But I 
		   really don't want to get married. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You are serious?  All these people 
		   are here and you are serious? 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, it's like, Emily had turned 
		   into this whole different person. 
		   I mean, at first, she was this 
		   girl that I really liked to have 
		   sex with.  Then she turned into 
		   this other girl who I really don't 
		   want to marry -- although I don't 
		   mind having sex with her. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Look, the catering is paid for. 
		   The tents are all set up.  Your 
		   grandparents flew half way around 
		   the world.  Besides, all men go 
		   through the same thing the night 
		   before their wedding. 


					  STEVE 
		   You mean, all guys feel sort of 
		   nervous and anxious, and kind of 
		   hope a train hits her and she eats 
		   a can of botulism or maybe she 
		   could hang out with a deer, and a 
		   hunter accidently shoots her or 
		   you know, when she's sleeping and 
		   she makes that nose whistle sound 
		   and you shake her to make it quiet 
		   but what you'd really like to do 
		   is take her stupid red toothbrush 
		   and ram it up her nostril into her 
		   skull. 


   Mr. Butabi stares at him for a beat. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Steve, these feelings are 
		   perfectly normal.

   DOUG'S POV 


   Wedding chairs.  Tents.  Flowers.  Suddenly, we hear a

					  STEVE 
				(assuming it's real) 
		   Doug, sorry I missed you.  I guess 
		   you heard I'm gettng married 
		   tommorow.  I was just wondering if

   Steve exits.  Doug peels through the window at him.

   EXT BUTABI BACK YARD - DAY 


   Beautiful wedding layout. 


   Guests mill about.  Craig is lifting an ice sculpture off 
   it's base.  Steve is next to him. 


					  STEVE 
		   Craig, I know you can lift it. 
		   Now can you just listen to me? 


					  CRAIG 
				(putting down 
				 sculpture) 
		   I got it.  I walk down the aisle. 
		   I stand next to you.  And I settle 
		   any inter-wedding party 
		   skirmishes. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, you're the best man.  Not the 
		   wedding bouncer.  You just gotta 
		   back me up. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Oh, you mean like spotting you? 


					  STEVE 
		   Exactly. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Now, I get it.  If things get too 
		   heavy, I step in.  Like a 
		   relationship spotter. 
				(overwhelmed) 
		   Thank you, man.  I won't let you 
		   down. 


   FATHER WILLIAMS, a grey-haired priest, Phil Donahue-type, 
   walks over. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Okay, boys, we're about ready to 
		   start.  You look very nice, 
		   Steven. 


					  STEVE 
		   Thank you, Father.  I love what 
		   you're wearing also. 


   He's in regular black priest garb.  He exits, confused. 


   BACK OF WEDDING AISLE 


   Steve walks up to Mr. Butabi, who is waiting with the 
   procession.  WEDDING MARCH BEGINS. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know, Dad, I've been thinking. 
		   I didn't really have time to have 
		   a bachelor party and that's a 
		   pretty important part of the 
		   marriage experience.  So, we may 
		   want to consider delaying the 
		   wedding a couple of hours so we 
		   can go to a strip club or 
		   something. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Sh!  We're starting. 


   WEDDING AISLE 


   Richard Grieco, in tux, walks down the aisle with a 
   frumpy BRIDESMAID. 


					  BRIDESMAID 
		   Richard Grieco?  How do you know 
		   Steve? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Look, I just don't want to be 
		   sued. 


   Craig, the best man, begins walking down with the maid of 
   honor. 


					  CRAIG 
				(to maid of honor) 
		   Alright... it's a long walk... 
		   pace yourself. 


  Craig takes pulse, looks at his watch.  Grandma and 
  Grandma Butabi walk down the aisle.  As they approach 
  Craig... 


					  CRAIG 
				(excited) 
		   Grandma, you look unbelievable! 
		   Woo! 


   MR. BUTABI AND STEVE AND BARBARA 


   Walk  down the aisle.  Steve is wearing a CD walkman -- 
   Mr. Butabi notices and yanks it off.  They pass a pretty 
   girl.  Steve veers off course. 


					  STEVE 
				(to girl) 
		   What's up?  You from out of town? 


   Mr. Butabi pulls Steve back on course. 


					  STEVE 
				(turns back to girl) 
		   See you at the reception. 


   EMILY 


   and her parents walk down the aisle... 


					  CRAIG 
		   Steve!  Getting married!  Go for 
		   it!  You are the man! 


					  EMILY 
				(yelling up to Craig) 
		   Shut up, Craig! I'm walking down 
		   the aisle, you dick! 


   Emily goes back to walking gracefully.  MARCH ENDS. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Dearly beloved, we are gathered 
		   here today, to join together... 


					  STEVE 
		   Father?  Did we already start? 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Yes. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh.  Sorry I thought there was 
		   going to be a buzzer or whistle or 
		   something. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   ... To join together this man and 
		   this woman in holy matrimony.  If 
		   any man can show any just cause 
		   why these two should not be 
		   lawfully joined together, speak 
		   now or forever hold his peace. 


   Nobody speaks.  Beat. 


					  CRAIG (O.S.) 
		   I am having a hell of a time! 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Very good.  Now I understand the 
		   bride and groom have each prepared 
		   something. 


					  EMILY 
				(trying  to rhyme) 
		   Dear Steve, today I wear this 
		   wedding gown, and on my face there 
		   is no frown.  I know our lives 
		   together will be great, just like 
		   when we saw David Copperfield on 
		   our first date.  If you set 
		   something free and it comes back, 
		   you should love it forever, and 
		   like one of your silk plants, I'll 
		   try to stay beautiful, that is my 
		   endeavor.  Love, forever, Emily. 


   Steve steps forward, takes out a piece of paper, reads. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, I used to see you outside 
		   my father's store.  And then we 
		   went out on some dates and you let 
		   me have sex with you. 


   Steve steps back.  Priest looks to see if Steve's done. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm done. 


					  FATHER 
		   Very nice.  Steven, do you promise 
		   to love Emily, comfort her, honor 
		   her, in sickness and in health, as 
		   long as you both shall live? 


					  STEVE 
		   My father already paid the caterer. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Emily, do you promise to comfort 
		   Steve, and honor him in sickness 
		   and health, as long as you both 
		   shall live? 


					  EMILY 
		   I do. 


   Mr. Butabi hands Steve the ring. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Now, Steven, repeat after me... 


					  STEVE 
		   'After me'... just kidding.  I'm 
		   nervous. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Now repeat after me, with this 
		   ring I thee wed... 


					  STEVE 
		   With this ring, I thee wed. 


   Steve puts the ring on her finger. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Now, Emily, repeat after me.  With 
		   this ring, I thee wed. 


					  EMILY 
		   With This ring -- 


   Suddenly, the ceremony is interrupted by the sound of the 
   GARAGE DOOR OPENING -- revealing... 


   DOUG 


   holding a huge boom box over his head, confidently 
   standing in place.  Emily rolls her eyes.  Mr. Butabi's 
   angry. 


					  STEVE 
				(in shock) 
		   Doug. 


   Doug hits the play button.  ""WHAT IS LOVE?"" by Haddaway 
   BLASTS. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(to organ player) 
		   Let's just keep it going. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Mr. Butabi, I can't -- 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Just ignore him. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
				(yelling) 
		   Say 'With this ring I thee...' 


					  EMILY 
		   With this ring -- 


   Doug TURNS UP the VOLUME, drowning out Emily. 


   Steve starts bopping his head.  Doug bops his head back. 


					  STEVE 
		   Sorry, Dad. 
				(turns back) 
		   Emily, I'm sorry.  I'm not ready 
		   yet.  I liked your poem. 


   Steve starts walking towards Doug.  Mr. Butabi, furious 
   follows him and reaches to stop him.  Suddenly, a hand 
   pulls him on his back.  We REVEAL it is... 


   CRAIG 


					  CRAIG 
		   I'm sorry, Mr. Butabi, but as best 
		   man, my primary duty is to allow 
		   the groom to beat a hasty retreat 
		   should the occasion take a sudden 
		   ugly turn. 


   Butabi tries to get around.  Craig jumps in the way. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Don't test me. 


   Steve runs up to Doug. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hello. 


   They run out of the back yard. 


   RICHARD GRIECO 


   Puts his arm around Mr. Butabi. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Mr. Butabi, as an actor, I'm a 
		   keen observer of human nature. 
		   And, I can tell that neither of 
		   your sons are anywhere near the 
		   maturity level necessary for this 
		   sort of commitment. 


   ALTAR 


   Emily is furious.  Craig steps in the groom's spot. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Go ahead, Father. 


					  EMILY 
		   What are you doing? 


					  CRAIG 
		   Emily, with all due respect to 
		   Steve, his discipline is lacking 
		   as is his appreciation for you. 
		   I, on the other hand, can bench 
		   press 305 lbs.  I squat a clean 
		   525, and my body fat percentage is 
		   less than two percent.  Not only 
		   am I a professional trainer, but I 
		   someday hope to market my own 
		   protein bars and produce an Iron 
		   Buns video. 


   Emily considers this a moment, then puts her arm through 
   his. 


					  EMILY 
		   ... Okay... We should look into 
		  infomercials.

   INT. HOLLYWOOD RESERVOIR - DAY 


   Steve and Doug are on the bridge tossing rocks. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... and I also took Craig out

					  STEVE 
		   Mm-hm. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was alright.  Plus, I rented 
		   a lot of videos and I didn't do 
		   much else. 


					  STEVE 
		   Uh-huh. 


					  DOUG 
		   Look, I, uh, I don't know... I 
		   just... Steve? 


   Steve is still looking at the water. 


					  DOUG 
		   Look, I'm sorry.  I said a lot of 
		   bad things before and... lately... 
		   I don't know. 


					  DOUG (CONT'D)

		   complete me! 


   Steve walks up to Doug.

   They hug and hold one another as the MUSIC SWELLS...

   EXT. BUTABI BACK YARD - LATER 


   The guests are gone.  In the empty tent, Richard Grieco 
   sits alone drinking wine with Mr. Butabi. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   And it seems to me that you're a 
		   little bit harder on Doug than you 
		   are on Steve.  Isn't that true? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You are right.  It's just that 
		   Doug is so rebellious, so hard to 
		   control. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Rebellious?  Scrappy?  Dreamer, 
		   maybe?  What other young man does 
		   that remind you of? 


   Mr. Butabi has an epiphany. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   ... Myself. 


   Richard nods, knowingly. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   So who are you really fighting 
		   with?

		   Of course you do, bro. 


					  DOUG

				(appreciating Doug's

		   Thanks, bro.  I'm glad you moved

					  DOUG 
		   Dad was kind of a sport about the 
		   wedding once Richard Grieco talked 
		   to him. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and isn't it a kick in the 
		   head how Emily hooked up with 
		   Craig.

   The Switchboard operator walks up to Doug.

		   Are you...? 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Doug? 


   They mentally put the voice with the face and are 
   immediately attracted. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR

   The female Police Officer who earlier pulled them over is 
   her friend.  Steve steps over. 


					  STEVE

EXT. VALLEY - DUSK 
Gold light dappling across a valley that seems to reach on forever. 
We ease back, revealing more - taking in the visual feast - finally 
discovering a seated figure facing out over the valley - a DOG at 
his feet. 

VIRGIL ANDERSON, life ahead of him - someone seemingly at ease with 
himself. As we watch. him a moment - SOUNDS become prominent - 
whistle of the wind through the grass - a bird's wings as it takes 
flight - a tree branch creaking under its own weight. And as he sits 
there, listening, we see the last rays of sunlight slip from the 
day. 

BLACK - and our TITLES come up. 

Then out of the darkness come a pair of HEADLIGHTS. - and we're: 

EXT. NEW YORK TURNPIKE - INTO PINECREST - DUSK 

An old BMW 2002 making its way up the Taconic Parkway. 

INT. BMW - DUSK 

On the radio: Whitney Houston's ""I'll Always Love You"". AMY TREMONT, 
30's, driving, on the phone. 

AMY
I'm lost Betsy, and you know me - 
I don't wear lost well - wait, wait I'm losing you...
(the cell phone glitches)
I'm pulling over before you disappear forever.


Amy pulls off the side of the road. Wrestles with a map and the 
phone. 

AMY
Sign? I was looking for a sign? There's no...


Her attention is caught by something off camera. She stares out into 
the night.. 

HER POV - A small iced over pond - and in the middle - moving about 
is Virgil, ICE SKATING - hockey stick in hand - moving about the 
rink with an imaginary puck. 

AMY (O.S.)
(distracted)
Yes... I took the first ..... no, no, I'm listening...


Virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice with his stick - throws 
his hands up in the air like he just scored. 

Amy smiles, peers off down the road. A sign: BEAR MTN. SPA AND 
RESORT 1.4 miles. 

AMY
Wait, I got it - yeah. No don't call me.. right, 
unless you hear from Atlanta. And fax me the 
designs - I want to tinker with them a bit more
... I'm going to rest - bye - I'll see you in a week.


Beep she hangs up. Looks back out to the pond. It's empty. Shrugs - 
about to pull out - that love song still blaring. 

AMY
Oh p-lease, Whitney.


CLICK - she shuts off the radio - and pulls back out onto the road. 

EXT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - NIGHT 

Amy pulling luggage out of her car. She takes a breath - clearly 
she's exhausted - and starts towards the entrance. 

INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - RECEPTION DESK - NIGHT 

Amy at the front desk with the Night Manager CAROLINE, 30'S, 
annoyingly fit. 

CAROLINE
 we have a full weight room, lifecycles, 
stairmasters, a spa, yoga, aerobics, spin classes...


AMY
I'm really just looking for a quick fix, here. 
Do you have anything that just involves lying down?


CAROLINE
A massage.


AMY
Great. I'll have one a day. Not too early.


INT. BEAR MTN. - MASSAGE WAITING AREA - NEXT DAY 

Amy enters, wearing sweats, she checks her watch - looks toward a 
closed door - about to grab a magazine when she hears from behind 
the door: 

WOMAN'S VOICE
Virgil, Oh God..., right there. Yes.


Amy's interest piques - the woman's murmur continuing - deep 
ecstasy. 

WOMAN'S VOICE
Yes there - a bit more...
(a small bell DINGS)
--wait - wait, you can't stop - one more minute - noo! 

VIRGIL'S VOICE
Sorry, Susan - time's up. 
I've got someone waiting.


And the door opens - and we see a woman, 60's, 
SUSAN, Bette Midler type, backing out of the room. 

SUSAN
Virgil, you have to come live with me.


VIRGIL'S VOICE
And what would your husband say? 
Amy, you out there? - c'mon in.


SUSAN
That's it - I'm getting a divorce.


Amy smiles as she passes Susan and enters. 

INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - DAY 

Virgil has his back to us as he prepares the table. The room is very 
ordered - every vial, bottle, towel has its exact spot. 

VIRGIL
Hey, Amy, I'm Virgil - why don't you 
get ready - hop up on the table.


Amy sees Virgil - his head turned slightly away - she drops her 
sweats and lies on the table, face down - pulling the sheet to cover 
herself. 

AMY
Sounds like you're a genius at this.


VIRGIL
(laughs)
That's right.. Mozart, Einstein, Virgil Anderson, massage therapist. 
Now I'm going to start working somewhat deep -
you let me know if you want anything deeper.


AMY
Deeper is good - where I come from, 
all you get is shallow.


VIRGIL
I like that - deep it is.


CLICK - he hits a button on a CD player and as we hear the soulful 
aria ""Mira, 0 Norma"" from Bellini's Norma. 

VIRGIL
First time in Pinecrest?


AMY
Came in late last night.. 
missed the town completely.


VIRGIL
If you came in broad daylight, 
you could still miss the town completely.


Dissolve to: 

Slow moving cuts of Virgil, working long strokes over Amy's body - - 
his hands gracefully LENGTHENING and STRETCHING her muscles. 

VIRGIL
Too much compute? work.


AMY
Uh-huh.


VIRGIL
Bad chair - you should think about a change.


AMY
(quiet)
Absolutely.


Virgil reaches his hands all the way down her spine and makes a move 
that causes Amy to release a very deep guttural sound. 

VIRGIL
Too deep?


AMY
No.. ..... just right.


Amy is now lost in another world - as Virgil shifts - working gently 
- not caressing - but molding - like a sculptor. 

A moment and Amy, surprisingly, begins to cry - softly. Virgil stops 
- takes a step back. 

VIRGIL
I - I'm sorry - it was too deep...


She cries for another few beats - then takes a breath. 

AMY No - it.. it's not you.. 
It's just things have kinda built up, 
I don't know why I'm crying.. look, 
this is embarrassing...


VIRGIL Don't be embarrassed - 
you obviously needed it. 
We should stop for today.


AMY Yeah, thanks. 
You always make the girls cry.


VIRGIL
Not since grade school. 
I'm going to go now - unless you'd like me to stay.


AMY
Could you - just for a minute?


VIRGIL
Of course, whatever you need.


Virgil sits next to her - then reaches out - takes her hand and 
starts a slow comforting massage - we see Amy visibly relax. 

AMY
You ever feel like a Martian's
invaded your entire body?


VIRGIL
Every day.


Amy, closes her eyes - smiling slightly in thanks. 

INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - LATER 

CAMERA pans slowly over to Amy asleep - and on the click of the door 
- her eyes dreamily open. 

AMY
Virgil?


INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - LATE DAY 

Hallway outside the massage area. Amy exits the change room, now 
wearing her sweats - pulling on her sneakers. 

VIRGIL (O.S.)
(calling out)
Hey Caroline, you look incredible today.


CAROLINE (O.S.)
(laughing)
Quite a compliment, Virgil. See ya tomorrow.


VIRGIL (O.S.)
See ya.


Amy looks down the hall - sees a glimpse of Virgil rounding the 
corner. She chases after hi~n into the reception area where she sees 
him exiting the door and moving of f down the driveway. 

AMY
Virgil - wait...


He's gone. Hopping along, tugging on her last sandal - she decides 
to go after him - fighting her way through a large tour group just 
checking in. 

EXT. BEAR MTN. SPA - LATE DAY 

Virgil in the distance, moving his way towards the main street. Amy 
exiting the building - trying not to slip on the ice as she, hurries 
after him - trying to get close enough to call out. 

Virgil stops at a main roadway as Amy comes up behind him. 

AMY
Virgil, hey.


Virgil turns - sunglasses on - looks directly at Amy. 

VIRGIL
Yes.


AMY
It's Amy - Amy Tremont.


VIRGIL
Of course - you were sleeping, 
didn't want to wake you.


AMY
Yes thanks - you're the skater, right - 
I saw you last night, coming in. 
Pretty mean slapshot. 
You play on some team or something?


VIRGIL
Yeah, something. You a hockey fan?


AMY
Always liked it - never get around to 
seeing a game. But I loved to skate 
as a kid - unfortunately I have two left feet.


VIRGIL
(playing with her) 
They look perfectly OK with me.


Amy laughs, starts relaxing - unconsciously starts to flirt. Head 
cocked, shifts her weight on one foot, moving slightly closer. 

AMY
I love the view you get here.


VIRGIL
Same here - I never get used to it.


Just then a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up in front of him and WHOOSH 
the doors pop open revealing CARL KIPLING, black, a hundred years 
old. Virgil turns as a few kids pile off the bus.. 

VIRGIL
Well, this is my ride. 
Hey Tommy, my man.


And with his hand extended a kid high fives it. Amy looks up - a BUS 
full of young school kids. Seems odd. 

TOMMY
Virge.


As the kid moves off. 

AMY
Well, I just wanted to apologize for back there - 
blubbering like that - I was just in a weird place.


VIRGIL
And now...


AMY
Now, I'm fine - so I wanted to 
thank- you. For what you did.


VIRGIL
For making you cry.


AMY
No, I made me cry - and you handled 
it great - didn't freak or anything.
(beat)
Is my mascara smeared or something?


VIRGIL
(laughs)
No. Why?


AMY
You're just looking at me funny.


CARL
Virgil - lets move it.


VIRGIL
As I said earlier - I just never get used to the view.


Virgil starts towards the bus, reaching behind to his pack. Pulls 
something out. 

VIRGIL
See you tomorrow.


And CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - a WHITE CANE unfolds in his hand. And he 
taps his way to the bus. 

AMY
See you... oh my God.


VIRGIL
What?


AMY
You're, you're -- I'm so sorry.


VIRGIL
(smile)
Hey, you already apologized once 
- no need to overdo it. Bye now.


Amy doesn't know how to respond. And he moves into the front seat of 
the bus - amongst ""Hey Virgil's"" from the school kids and Ca-chunk 
the doors close - the Yellow Bus steaming off - past Amy, as she 
stares at Virgil in the front seat - about to wave to him - then 
realizing he wouldn't see. 

As she turns and watches the bus move off down the street - a hand 
comes out - Virgil's - and waves good-bye. 

EXT. VIRGIL'S HOME.- DUSK 

The BUS stopping in front of Virgil's home - a side-by-side DUPLEX 
at the edge of surrounding woods. 

Virgil steps into the street and with a HONK the bus pulls away. He 
turns, grazes his hand across a tree out front - and starts towards 
his home. 

AT THE PORCH - he hesitates at the first door. Finds it with his 
hand - then raps on it. 

No answer. He moves over to his own door - and goes inside. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EVENING 

As he enters, Sophie, an aging LAB, lays on the couch. 

VIRGIL
Get of f the couch, Sophie.


As the dog slides guiltily off the couch. 

VIRGIL
Some seeing eye dog - 
more like sleeping eye dog.


Virgil bends down as he passes the coffee table to pick up the 
REMOTE CONTROL placed just so. Click - a Game Show pops on. 

VIRGIL
Met a girl today - nice voice -
followed me out of the building.


Sophie barks. 

VIRGIL
No she wasn't a stalker.


CLOSE ON Virgil's hand flipping open a large book marked ""TV HOCKEY 
SCHEDULE"" - it's completely WHITE - all in BRAILLE. 

JENNIE (O.S.)
Sophie's just worried about you - 
she watches too many horror movies.


In the kitchen, JENNIE ANDERSON, older than Virgil, simply dressed, 
putting a just made dinner carefully onto a plate. 

VIRGIL
Hey, you're here - so how 
are the kids today?


Running his hand down the pure white page - he finds what he wants: 
BAP - he hits the channel changer and the game comes on. 

JENNIE
The usual - need a lot of attention. So who's the girl?


Moving into the kitchen, Virgil puts the remote to the side of the 
refrigerator where it VELCRO sticks to an exact spot. 

VIRGIL
From the spa. I made her cry.


JENNIE
You haven't done that since-- 


VIRGIL/JENNIE
-- grade school.


VIRGIL
(smile)
That's what I told her. Coke?


Virgil moves past Jennie as she goes into the living room - hand up, 
door open and he's got a glass. Back to the fridge, he grabs a coke. 

JENNIE
I'm fine. Your dinner's ready - chicken's 
at 3 o'clock - rice is at...


VIRGIL
6 o'clock, peas at 9 o'clock 
and news at 11.


Jennie places Virgil's dinner down in an exact spot on a coffee 
table (facing away from the TV). 

JENNIE
(laughs)
One day I'm going to switch them on you.


VIRGIL
And one day I'll play forward 
for the New York Rangers.


Four precise steps into the room and Virgil plops down on the sofa - 
finds his fork. Jennie moves to a counter where a pile of school 
books sit. 

JENNIE

Ha - ha. You need new jokes.


VIRGIL
Or a new sister. 

JENNIE
I'd work on the jokes.


Picking up the books she moves past Virgil - pecks him on the head 
and moves to the door. 

VIRGIL
You want to watch some hockey?


JENNIE
(at the door)
You want to grade some spelling tests? 
(beat)
I'll be next door you need me.


She leaves and Virgil pats the couch and Sophie hops up next to him. 

VIRGIL
You know this girl - for one moment -
she actually thought I could
(Sophie grumbles as she settles in) 
I'm not kidding. 
(beat) And she had this great voice - relaxing - 
soft like a breeze through
(beat)
Wonder what she thinks about ""blind dates."" 


INT. AMY'S ROOM - EVENING 

Amy in bed - just out of the shower - the only light in the room 
comes from the TV. She has the remote, mindlessly switching channels 
- not staying on one for more than a second or two. 

Click - an Odd Couple rerun - click - ESPN bowling - click - Three 
Stooges - Moe poking Curly in the eye - click - click - click. 

Bored, she stops - notices a small scarf on a chair next to the bed. 
She picks it up, holds it against her eyes and ties it tight around 
her head. 

She stands - hands out in front of her - starts to walk across the 
room - not so bad - WHAM - right into a side table. Shit that hurts! 
Grabbing her leg, she hops - hits a lamp. 

AMY
DAMMIT!


Ripping the towel of f her head - hopping around on one foot - she 
hears: 

KNOCK KNOCK 

AMY
Coming!


Rubbing her leg - she limps/half walks to the door - opens it to: 

Virgil: dark glasses, cane, smile 

AMY
Virgil..?


She pulls a towel in closer - then realizes it doesn't matter 

VIRGIL
My turn to apologize. I should have told 
you I was blind it wasn't fair.


AMY
That's OK. You want to come in -
I just got out of the shower - give me 
a minute to get changed?


VIRGIL
(as he moves in)
Sure, I promise I won't look.


As Amy starts to get changed in the bathroom. 

VIRGIL
Anyways, I was in the neighborhood -- 
actually the whole town's my neighborhood 
-- and since you've never been to our
illustrious village, I thought maybe we could 
go into town - see what we see.


AMY
See what we see?


VIRGIL
Figure of speech
. 

AMY
You mean right now, tonight?


VIRGIL
Great - I'm blind and you're deaf - what a pair.


EXT. MAIN STREET - EVENING 

A few store windows lit up. Some people eating dinner at a 
streetside cafe. Virgil, holding Amy's arm as they walk down the 
street. 

WITH AMY AND VIRGIL WALKING: 

VIRGIL
... the Mechanic at the top of the street is Doug - smokes too 
much - but a good guy. Three steps down is Carlson's hardware
- he's got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games
together - he's a Devil's fan. And just up ahead should be Grady's 
junk shop - he calls it ""antiques""...
Smells like junk. I'd hate to see what it looks like
. 

A woman bustles past, NANCY BENDER, weighed down with groceries. 

VIRGIL
(intuitively)
Hey Nancy.


NANCY
Hey Virgil - got that book in for you.


VIRGIL
Nancy's our librarian, brings in 
any braille book I want.


NANCY
(to Amy)
The guy's nuts about the pyramids -
anything he can get his hands on...


VIRGIL
Thank-you Nancy - you should get your
groceries home - your ice cream's melting.


Nancy laughs - as she moves off. 

AMY
Nice place - you seem to know everyone here.


VIRGIL
Moved here when I was eight. 
My family figured it would be a 
good place for me to grow up. 
Tell me what you see.


AMY
Well, there's a good structure to the 
town - genuine lines, good use of space. 
To be honest I'd find a better balance 
to a lot of these buildings. But that's me.


VIRGIL
What's you?


AMY
The architect in me - can't leave well
enough alone. Art school in college - 
I made the arms for the Venus DeMilo. 
(realizing he probably doesn' t understand)
see, the Venus De Milo has no arms and...


VIRGIL
(laughs)
I know the Venus De Milo has no arms, and 
the Mona Lisa has this captivating smile
and David doesn't wear a fig leaf.


AMY
How do you...


VIRGIL
I may not have been a lot of places -
but I read about things, then make an
image up here -- (points to his head)
--that works for me.


Grazing his hand across a telephone pole - Virgil stops - turns to 
Amy. 

VIRGIL
This is the end of the street. 
We should turn back.


AMY
What about past the end of the street? 
What's out there?


He turns around. 

VIRGIL
(shrugs)
Nothing.


AMY
No - there's an old run down 
building off to the side...


VIRGIL
Must be the old firehouse. 
It had a fire so they shut it down. (Amy laughs)
Honest to God.
(intrigued)
What else do you see?


AMY
A wall of shrubs - 
a field with an interesting configuration of trees.


The wind has picked up a bit. 

VIRGIL
Tell me how you see it.


AMY
(enjoying the game)
OK, sure. Let's see - long and elegant. Like -- 
like a woman dancing with two lovers, trying 
to decide which one she loves.


Virgil stops a moment - takes in the image. 

AMY
What?


VIRGIL
It's just - the image you just 
gave me - ""Dancing trees. - I like that.


Virgil stops - his head cocks slightly. 

VIRGIL
We should go - it's starting to rain.


AMY
(looking around) 
There's a bit of a breeze but-- 


KABOOM - thunder - and the rain just drops. 

INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 

They run in laughing - Amy closing the door behind them as Virgil 
moves his way into the center of the room - stands where the 
moonlight from a high window hits the floor. Water runs down the 
outside glass, causing the light to ripple across him. The room is 
empty - almost surreal. 

AMY
I can't believe how fast it happens...

(she sees Virgil - his head cocked towards the ceiling) 

AMY
Virgil?


Virgil's head turns toward her. 

VIRGIL
You like rain - I love the rain.


AMY
(moving to him)
What were you just doing there?


Virgil slowly moves his head about, sensing the room. 

VIRGIL
Listening - the rain - it brings out the 
contours of everything, gives life to 
a room I can't see.


WE SEE SLOW MOVING CUTS of the building as Virgil describes what he 
hears. 

VIRGIL 
You hear it?...on the roof dripping down the 
walls on every side. On the right, on the 
drainpipe, it's drumming with a deeper, 
steadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing 
across the room - tells me the room is large 
- open. You feel it - in your chest? On the left, 
the rain says... (he listens)
...a fire escape, with it's own rhythm 
- ping - ping. Then listen - there...
(he points)
--what's that - over there...?


AMY
Looks like it's...


VIRGIL
No, listen for it - not what it 
looks like - what it becomes. 
Come here.


Amy moves closer - Virgil puts his hands out on her shoulders - 
turns her to the sound. 

VIRGIL
Now just listen to it - shut out
everything but that sound - 
do you hear it?


Amy strains to listen - closes her eyes - her head instinctively 
turning - no in unison with Virgil's 

AMY
Yes - there - it's soft - like a shimmer


VIRGIL
The wind blowing the rain against a window.


AMY
(smile)
Like a cymbal. It's like our own 
percussive symphony, isn't it?


Amy opens her eyes - looks about the room - listening. 

VIRGIL
The world is invisible to me - with my touch it comes 
alive. But only one thing at a time. But when it's raining,
I feel everything at once. Sometimes, I wish it could 
rain inside rain all around us.


AMY
(musing)
""Einfuehlung.""


VIRGIL
What?


AMY
Einfuehlung - it's an architectural term. 
It means to share an empathy. 
Been a long time since I felt that.


And as they stand listening to the rain, playing its music - Amy 
watches him - fascinated by him - then shivers slightly. 

VIRGIL 
You're cold, we should go.


AMY
No, I'm fine, really. It was just something passing 
through me - can't explain it - a good thing.


Amy smiles at him - then quietly realizes 
he can't see it. She moves close, her 
hand reaching out and taking his. 

AMY
What you just showed me  how 
I feel - makes me smile.


She takes his hand - hesitates - then puts it on the side of her 
face. 

VIRGIL
I see it now. Thank-you.


We hold a beat - enjoying the symphony of rain - then cut to: 

EXT. BEAR MTN. LODGE - MORNING 

The sun warming the cool morning air. The school bus pulling away to 
reveal Virgil making his way into work. 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
I thought after yesterday, 
you'd never get up on my table again.


INT. MASSAGE ROOM - NEXT DAY 

Amy on the table. Virgil squirting oil in his hand - preparing. 

AMY
You kidding? today, I'm looking 
for a complete nervous breakdown.


VIRGIL
I love a challenge.


And as he places his palms carefully on her back - working her back 
slowly we hear opera play quietly in the background. 

DISSOLVE TO:
Virgil's hands on the small of her back - something amazingly 
sensual about how he works her muscles. Amy speaks to him in low 
tones - in a state of complete relaxation. 

AMY
Can I ask how long you've been blind?


VIRGIL
Of course, most people avoid the subject. You tell them 
you're blind and they act surprised. ""You're blind? Reallv? 
I didn't know - you hide it so well."" And then they wave their
hand in front of your face just to make sure. (beat)
It started when I was a little over a year old.


Virgil's hands move down Amy's sides - slow - feeling each contour - 
the oil making her skin glisten. Amy moves her head slightly with 
his touch. She lets out a small breath of air. 

AMY
(quiet)
You see shadows?


VIRGIL
No. Congenital cataracts. And a case of retinitis 
pigmentosa thrown in for good measure. 
This area needs to loosen up.


AMY
I think you're doing it. 
(beat)
No bright lights, nothing?


VIRGIL
I'm blind as a bat. Actually, blinder 'cause they 
emit sonar all the time. I don't have a sixth sense,
I just don't have the fifth one. I can't hear things in 
Vermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no 
- I don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder.


Amy murmurs in response to Virgil's touch. 

VIRGIL
You say something?


AMY
No, I just - this feels nice - too nice.


Virgil moves his hands down her back - sensually kneading each 
muscle. It's clear he's enjoying this as much as she is. 

AMY
You're very good.. at what you do.


Another breath exhales from her involuntarily as Virgil hits a 
sensitive spot. 

VIRGIL
Thank-you.


AMY
You enjoy it.


VIRGIL
At times. Some clients make it 
more enjoyable than others.


Virgil now works down her thighs - Amy's back arching slightly with 
the movement - both of them heating to the moment. Both their 
breaths quickening. 

AMY
And this client...


VIRGIL
Is very, very...


DING - and the spell is broken. 

AMY
What?


VIRGIL
Sorry - it's time. I've got Mr. Ketchum coming in next - 
all two hundred pounds. Sorry - I felt like we 
were just getting started.


Amy sits up on the table - the sheet pulling away slightly revealing 
her. For a moment she watches him - his head turned towards her - 
but not seeing. Then she slowly pulls the sheet up covering herself. 

AMY
Thank-you. For last night as 
well - love to do it again.


VIRGIL
How about I cook dinner then, tonight.


AMY
I'd like that.


INT. BEAR MIN. - NEXT DAY 

Aerobics step class. Amy working out. In front of her two rather 
large women in neon stretch workout clothes - Amy tries to avoid the 
view - a thought - and she shuts her eyes as she continues her 
exercise. 

INT. BEAR MTN. - NEXT DAY 

Amy, towel around her neck - coming in from the workout. 

CAROLINE
Amy 


INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - NIGHT 

Onions frying. Tilt up to Virgil - cutting the last of it and 
putting it in the pan - sizzling as it hits. Vegetables and a box of 
pasta are arranged on the countertop. Sophie watches the 
proceedings. 

RRRRINNNG - the phone. 

Virgil stops cutting - his hand easily finds the phone. 

INTERCUT WITH  

Amy: on the phone in her car on the Taconic Parkway. 

AMY
Virgil - it's Amy. I - I can't make dinner - 
I'm really sorry - an emergency came up - 
they're dragging me back to New York.


VIRGIL
Oh. Yeah. Anything serious?


AMY
The project we were working on was rejected - 
could go down the drain. I'll deal with it quick - 
I'd like to come back.


VIRGIL
Yeah. Good. Well. I'll be here.


Virgil hangs up the phone - frustrated, he reaches for the frying 
pan - and promptly burns his hand. 

VIRGIL
-DAMN IT!!!


Dropping the pan - Sophie goes scurrying, as he kicks at it - 
sending it across the room. He turns - thrusts his hand under the 
sink - turning on the cold water. 

VIRGIL
Shit - that was stupid.


EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT - LATE DAY 

Evening rush hour traffic surrounding the Flatiron building. 

VOICE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
I'm just saying there seems to be something missing.

INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT DESIGN - DAY 

A small cardboard model of what looks like a small mini-mall. Amy 
sits in front of it - drawing on a sketch pad. The office is sparse, 
functional. A few DRAFTSMEN can be seen in the background through a 
glass partition. 

DUNCAN
Absolutely Mr. Falk - something lj missing - we realize that now. We 
just need some time to figure out what.


DUNCAN ROSWELL, 30's, leaning a little too ardently into a speaker 
phone. The voice on the other end is JACK FALK - their would be 
employer. Their assistant BETSY ERNST, early 20's, sits in the 
corner, taking notes. 

FALK 
Fine - but you all know what kind of schedule we're on here?


DUNCAN
(watching Amy)
And budget. Yes sir. Don't worry, we won't let you down.


She takes a piece of paper, has an idea, starts sketching - Duncan 
hangs up. 

DUNCAN
Don't say it, I know. You were never happy with the design.


AMY 
I wasn't going to say that.


DUNCAN
But you'd have tinkered with it till the job went away. So now we've 
got him hooked, you've got your second chance.


And Amy shoves her rough sketch across the table. 

AMY
Look at these site photos - see those 
trees - we were going to get rid of them 
- let's incorporate them into the design 
use what's natural about the location. 
(Duncan stares at her) 
And by the way - the 53rd St. lobby - coming 
back from Pinecrest, I came up with a new 
addition - add some life to that place.


Duncan stares at the sketch - then looks up at Amy 

DUNCAN 
OK -- what's going on here? We sent Hydra 
the three headed monster off a few days ago 
and got back Mary Poppins in return.


AMY
What? I can't have a couple of ideas. 
(even Betsy stares at her)
Fine, you want to know - I met a guy.

Betsy stands. 

BETSY 
Too modern for me.


DUNCAN 
Sit down.Betsy. We're all friends here. 
So - spill the beans.


AMY 
Nothing to spill - he's a good guy - 
smart, funny, blind...
DUNCAN 
Whoa, whoa - wait a minute - Blind!? 
Like tap-tap, white cane blind? Come on 
Amy - I mean, I know you like 
challenges, hell you married me - but...


AMY 
I knew you'd be understanding.


DUNCAN 
(standing) 
No, no I am. You're right, this is none 
of my business anymore - but a blind
guy? If you're lonely - in my. opinion 
-- get a puppy.


BETSY 
Duncan, don't be a jerk.


DUNCAN 
You still work here.


He's gone. 

BETSY 
He's just jealous.


AMY
So much for the ""we're all friends here"" idea.


INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT OFFICES - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON - Computer screen. A cursor blinks - then the words 
CONGENITAL BLINDNESS - a CLICK and a web page for the AMERICAN 
BRAILLE INSTITUTE comes up. 

WIDE - we see Amy hovering over her computer - various sketches of 
the proposed building next to her - two giant Magnolia trees have 
been incorporated into the design. As we watch her search on the 
computer we move over her shoulder to see in the corner of her plans 
- a sketch of the intertwined ""dancing trees"" and the Firehouse. 

Betsy enters carrying her jacket. 

BETSY 
Everybody's gone for the day.


AMY 
Thanks. You go ahead - I'm just finishing 
up something here.


She turns to look at Betsy who now peers over her shoulder - sees 
what she's doing. Amy looks up at her - sees Betsy's look. 

AMY 
What? I just want to know a little more 
about what's wrong with him.


BETSY 
(pause) 
Amy? Friend to friend?


AMY 
Shoot


BETSY
I hate to admit it but I agree 
with Duncan on this one.
AMY
(back to the computer) 
Don't shoot.
BETSY
He makes sense sometimes. My father had 
a problem a few years back with severe 
cataracts. Do you have any idea what 
you're getting into?


Amy spins in her chair - looks to Betsy. 

AMY 
You ever listened to rain - 
I mean really listened?


BETSY 
This like that smell the roses thing?


AMY
(turns to her) 
I've spent the last five years of my adult 
life with a man who has the emotional 
content of a soap dish. The only time I 
saw him cry was doing our tax return three 
years ago.
(beat) 
I need more than that, Betsy. For once in a 
long, long time I feel like I can breathe again. 
Just the way he touches me I know I found 
someone I can connect with.


BETSY 
Ah, here we go.


AMY 
No, no. I can tell he's sensing everything about 
me with a simple touch. He listens to my every 
word as if it's the only sound on the planet - 
I feel like even though he can't see me, he knows 
everything about me. He just moves me - does that 
sound crazy.


BETSY 
(beat) 
Does he have a brother?

EXT: PINE CREST MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY 

The FROZEN POND, nestled against a strand of pine. Virgil skates 
fast across the ice enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey 
stick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond - feels it with the 
stick and slams to a stop. 

He shuffles his body around to face in the other direction - then 
starts skating again - passing AMY standing on the snow covered 
bank. 

ON AMY - smiling, watching Virgil - enjoying his release of energy. 

HER POV - VIRGIL - skating well, a look of relaxation we've never 
seen on his face. He skates in an arc coming back past Amy. 

Finally she speaks. 

AMY 
Wayne Gretzky, look out.


Virgil slams to a halt in surprise - nearly toppling over. 

AMY 
Sorry -- sorry. 
Didn't mean to scare you.


VIRGIL 
Amy?!


AMY 
I said I'd come back.


VIRGIL 
How long ... how long have you been...?


AMY 
Watching you? Just got here - 
couldn't find you at the spa - took
a chance you'd be here. You're very good.


VIRGIL 
Skated since I was a kid. My dad taught me 
- wanted me to play pro one day. 
How do you like my pond?
AMY
It's beautiful.


VIRGIL 
Describe it for me.
AMY
OK. Let's see. Like cool 
blue silk - you know blue?


VIRGIL 
I think so - keep going.


AMY 
Blue silk stretched tight across 
a bowl - surrounded by white 
jacketed sentries of trees on 
the horizon, protecting it from 
the outside world.


VIRGIL 
Horizon's a tough one.


AMY 
What?


VIRGIL 
Never understood horizon - if touch it - 
don't know what it that's OK I liked 
the rest of picture. 
(he starts moving towards her) 
You want to skate?


AMY 
Sorry, I didn't bring my skates.


VIRGIL 
Don't need them. Come on step hold of my stick.


AMY 
Excuse me?


VIRGIL
(smile) 
Hockey stick. Here.


He holds the stick out like a cross bar. Amy moves cautiously 
forward and takes hold of it. 

VIRGIL 
OK. Now hold on for balance. 
I used to do this with Jennie when we were kids.


And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling Amy with him. Amy is 
apprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement - the 
sensation - both of them laughing out loud. 

WIDE as we see them move about the rink - Amy sliding and being 
pulled by Virgil. As he picks up speed we hear Amy scream in 
delight. 

AMY 
Look out - we're running out of ice.


Virgil turns expertly, arcing around the edge of the ice but Amy 
loses her nerve - and balance - and lets go of the stick and goes 
flying into an embankment. The momentum carries Virgil off down the 
ice - both of them laughing hysterically. 

VIRGIL 
You OK?


AMY 
Fine. Never been dumped so fast in my life.


VIRGIL 
Me, dump you? No way. Stay where you are 
- I'll come to you - just keep talking.


Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment. 

AMY 
What do I say?


Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for Amy. 

VIRGIL 
(hearing her voice, veering in her direction) 
Anything - how'd you become an architect?


AMY 
God - let's see - I was in college - 
art school - a little aimless - and I met
this guy -. an architect - opened up a new 
world to me. I liked the structure the 
control - finding problems, coming up with 
solutions - when I graduated - we started 
a company together - on impulse got married
- which was crazy - divorced a year ago - 
but we're still partners.. which must seem
even crazier.


And Virgil's suddenly there - going a little too far - tumbling off 
the pond and into her. 

VIRGIL 
You'd think I meant to do that. 
A patented move.


They're close - in the snow together - face to face. 

AMY
(Amy smiles, realizes) 
This is tough.


VIRGIL 
What?


AMY 
I bat my eyelashes, toss my head just 
right, and there's this very sexy thing 
I do with my eyes - then realize none of 
it matters to you.


VIRGIL 
It doesn't matter. 
Tell me what you look like.


AMY 
I.. .1 don't know I'm...


VIRGIL 
Wait. Let me.


He puts his hand out, over her face -- hesitates, then slowly feels 
down the contours of her cheek, her eyelids, the shape of her lips - 
Amy moving with the touch, the sensuality of it - and as he 
continues - Amy's hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil 
smiles. 

VIRGIL 
Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek.. 
you are very beautiful.


AMY 
Thank-you. So are you - more than 
I could describe.


Virgil's hands move down her face - closing her eyes - letting her 
just experience his touch - his exploring. 

And as both their hands continue, enjoying the sensation of 
discovering each other - Amy leans forward, her eyes still closed, 
finding his mouth - grazing his lips with her own - softly, gently, 
then they fold into each other's arms locked into a warm, deep kiss. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

It's dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked 
bodies. A fire burns in the background. In flowing CUTS we see them 
make love: 

Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her hand to his chin - 
lifts his head - then kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm 
with Virgil's movements. 

Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes - feels it the way 
Virgil would - moving faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in 
mutual release -- and she collapses on top of him - a deep breath 
and she rolls over - cuddles into his arm. 

A long beat - out of breath: 

AMY 
So -- that's what a blind date is.


They breathe - then both start laughing - quietly - then 
hysterically together as Virgil wraps her up in his arms - holding 
her tightly. 

EXT. PINECREST - DAWN 

The horizon. The sun cresting it - bringing a new light to the day. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EARLY MORNING Sounds of a shower in the 
background. Amy in Virgil's robe, pulls a juice container out of the 
fridge - pours herself a glass, putting the juice on the counter as 
she walks into the living room - taking in the sparseness of his 
surroundings. 

CLOSE ON - an open Braille Book. The completely white pages with 
minute bumps. Amy pulls up a chair, sits - and flips through the 
book, running her hand across the pages - trying to understand his 
world. 

She then turns to the front cover to see what it is. Playboy. 

We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles, puts the book down - pushes 
the chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall: 

Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a few years older - and 
his mother and father. Then another picture next to it - Virgil in 
his skates and Jennie older - no father - Sophie at their feet. 

And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he and Jennie on the 
front porch - his arms wrapped around his sister like he's never 
going to let go. 

VOICE (O.S.) 
Hello?


Amy turns to see - Jennie, carrying a bag under her arm. 

AMY 
Hello.


Jennie moves towards the kitchen. 

JENNIE 
I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister. 
And you are..?


Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair. 

VIRGIL
Jen, this is Amy Tremont.


Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the juice container - places 
it back in the fridge - just so. 

JENNIE
I was just at the market Virgil, 
picking up a few things before 
school - and I thought you might like some...


VIRGIL 
(smells) 
Apples and bananas.
Amy sees the fruit on the counter - impressed. 

JENNIE 
He's being a show-off, Amy - I always bring him these. 
(putting them in the fridge) 
The apples are on the bottom shelf...


VIRGIL 
At two o'clock. Oranges at 10. 
I know, thanks.


JENNIE 
Amy -- you in town long...


And WHAM - Virgil moving into the room, collides right into the 
chair Amy moved - knocking into a lamp sending it to the ground. 
Jennie immediately rushes over. 

AMY 
Virgil?


VIRGIL 
I'm fine.


JENNIE 
No you're not - you're bleeding. 
(turning to Amy, sudden) 
First lesson with a blind man, 
Amy - don't change anything - 
it's too dangerous


AMY 
(moving to Virgil)
I'm sorry - I didn't know...


VIRGIL
It was my fault. I'm OK.


Jennie still dabbing at his leg. 

VIRGIL
(embarassed, snaps) 
Goddamit, Jennie - I said I was OK 
- leave me alone!


Jennie hesitates, then stands to go - sees the hockey book out of 
place. A glance to Amy and she picks it up - quietly moves it back 
to it's rightful spot. 

JENNIE 
I've got parent meetings tonight - 
there's dinner in the freezer - left corner.
(turns to Amy) Nice to have met you, Amy.


AMY 
Me too - and again - I'm sorry.


And she's gone - leaving Amy and Virgil together - a moment of 
awkwardness. 

AMY 
She seemed ... nice.


VIRGIL 
She seemed jealous.


AMY 
Your leg is still bleeding.


VIRGIL 
It'll stop - happens all the time. 
Welcome to my world.
We hold on Amy - taking this in: 

INT. BEAR MTN. - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Japanese lanterns criss-cross across an open area. Guests of the spa 
mingle about - drinks in hand - some dance on a floor set up over 
the aerobics area. Music plays in the background. 

Amy, carrying two trays of food, finds her way to where Virgil sits 
at a table off to the side - putting his food in front of him. 

AMY 
Let's see if I can get this right. 
Chicken's at three - salad at seven - 
vegetables at ten.


VIRGIL 
(picking up his fork) 
Very good - thank-you.


AMY 
This is nice. 
They do this every weekend?


VIRGIL 
Every Friday - for the guests leaving. Supposed to make them want to 
come back.


AMY 
(sits, uneasy) 
Love the music - 
Gershwin - makes you want to...


She stops. Virgil, fork poised over his food, senses her 
uncomfortableness. 

VIRGIL 
You like dancing?


AMY 
Hmmm? Yeah - don't do it much. 
(changing subject) 
Chicken's good.


Amy resumes eating - Virgil's fork spears something on his plate - 
raising it to his mouth - both we and Amy now see it's a large pat 
of butter. Too late - it's in his mouth. 

Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as he tastes it - then 
surreptitiously swallows it. Then realizes Amy saw him. 

VIRGIL 
Nothing like a good pat of fat. 
What do you say we dance?


AMY 
No, really, I'm fine...


Virgil is up - pulling her hand. 

VIRGIL 
Come on


She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders. 

VIRGIL 
Lead on.


And as she ushers him to the floor the music changes - a salsa - 
lively. Amy stops: 

AMY 
Different piece - maybe we should...


VIRGIL 
You kidding - take my hand.


And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the music - feeling the 
beat - in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own, something we've 
never seen before - uninhibited, wild - a little funny, but also 
there's something sensual in his abandonment. 

All Amy can do is hang on for the ride - enjoying Virgil enjoying 
himself. People even clear back a little to give him some room - 
however he moves about the floor easily - somehow sensing where the 
other couples are. 

It's a whirlwind moment - a moment where the two of them get lost 
with each other - for a second shutting out the world and it's just 
them, the music and their movement. 

Then suddenly the music is over. And they stop - the moment gone. 
Virgil turns to Amy and she applauds Virgil's wild moves 

He takes a bow with a flourish. Spins to another angle - another 
bow. Spins back again - a step back and: 

CRASSSH - he's into the buffet table - sliding to the ground - food 
spilling on top of him. Amy, can't help but laugh, rushes to him. 

AMY 
You have to teach me that move.


And Amy reaches down to his guacamole covered hand - and pulls him 
up into an embrace and as they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing 
- we see: 

INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 

Amy - on the phone - looking out her window. 

AMY 
Betsy - you were telling me about your father, 
his cataracts - you said he had a problem. 
How is he now? 
(she listens) 
Doctor - Dr. Aaron? - do you have his number?


INT. BEAR MTN. GYM - DAY 

A handful of people on various pieces of equipment. Virgil, tank 
top, heavy sweat, on a stationary bicycle - working out. Amy next to 
him on a treadmill - trying to keep up as Caroline from the front 
desk comes and hands her something. 

Amy reads it briefly then hops off the treadmill moving to Virgil. 

AMY
Virgil, I just got some great news.


VIRGIL 
(picking up speed again)
The Atlanta project?


AMY
No, no - I was talking to my assistant 
this morning - her father had these 
severe cataracts...


VIRGIL 
(slowing) 
Oh. Really.


AMY
She put me in touch with a Dr. Richard 
Aaron - the guy's the leading eye surgeon
on the eastern seaboard - he's been working 
with techniques - I don't know all the jargon 
- but I spoke to him earlier on the phone 
at the Institute...


VIRGIL 
You called this guy?


Virgil stops riding - starts to get off the bike. 

AMY 
(excited) 
I told him all about you - he just faxed me 
back - he'd love to get a look at your eyes 
- he thinks maybe, mavbe - there might be a 
chance of reversal.


Virgil faces Amy, best he can, while he pulls on his sweat jacket. 

VIRGIL 
I don't get it - am I missing the sign 
that says it's help the handicapped week.


Virgil starts to move away. Amy stops him. 

AMY 
I thought you'd be excited. What's the problem?


Virgil turns on her. 

VIRGIL
No problem. That's the whole point 
here Amy - there is no goddamned problem.


And Virgil turns and bumps into a stationary bike, he SHOVES it off 
to the side, and makes his way out of the gym. 

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 

Virgil enters, visibly upset - passing a CO-WORKER coming out of the 
shower. 

CO-WORKER 
Hey Virgil.


Virgil steams right past him - not answering - hands feeling down 
the lockers - finding his - he tugs it open - pulls off his shirt 
and throws it in. He takes a breath, settles himself - then SLAMS 
the locker door shut. 

EXT. JENNIE'S SCHOOL 

PARENTS are picking up their CHILDREN from Jennie's school. As 
Jennie helps the last of the kids into her mother's car - she looks 
up to see Amy across the street. 

JENNIE 
Amy, right?


Amy nods - starts towards her. 

AMY 
I'd like to talk to you if 
I could -- about Virgil.


JENNIE 
Something wrong?


AMY 
Sort of. There's something I don't 
understand. You see I spoke to a doctor 
who's apparently doing breakthrough 
work on cataracts -
(Jennie turns to Amy) 
- but when I brought it up to Virgil he acted as if...


JENNIE 
What don't you understand?


AMY 
If I was blind almost all my life -- 
and there was even a remote possibility 
I could see - I'd jump at it.


JENNIE 
When there's something you've adapted to, 
accepted - you'd just want to change 
it without even thinking about it? 
(beat) 
We're very comfortable here, Amy. 
Virgil has everything he needs.


AMY 
I thought just maybe he'd like to not 
be falling over things for the rest 
of his life. Look, I see...


JENNIE 
(cuts her off) 
Yes you do and Virgil doesn't. He spent 
the first eight years of his life having 
his eyes prodded, pierced and poked by 
doctors, faith healers, spiritualists, 
shamans and medicine men. My father had them 
lined up out the door. It hurt and disappointed 
us all and it almost killed him. He doesn't 
need to go through that again. Now - maybe 
you understand.


And she turns on her heel and is gone. 

EXT. VIRGIL'S COTTAGE - LATE DAY 

Amy making her way up to the porch - hearing from inside. 

VIRGIL (V.0.) 
No, no - why - why?!


She hurries up the steps, reaching the open door where she sees 
Virgil, his head in his hands. 

VIRGIL (V.0) 
I can't believe you're doing this to me.


AMY 
What - Virgil?


Virgil turns sharply - Sophie jumps up - starts barking. 

VIRGIL 
Sophie - stop it. Amy? C'mon in - it's just 
the Rangers. I could check better than these 
guys today.


AMY 
They lost?


VIRGIL 
I prefer to think of it as not winning.
I thought you would have been long gone
after that outburst from my evil twin
brother. We've had him committed you
know. Rikers Island - hard time. 
(standing)
Can I get you something - - Coke - beer?


AMY 
No - I - I'm fine. I just wanted apologize 
for stomping around in life like Bigfoot today.


Virgil turns towards Amy. 

VIRGIL 
Amy, you see the big tree outside? 
How far is it from my front porch?
AMY
Guessing, about thirty feet.


VIRGIL 
To you. But to me, it's fourteen steps exactly. 
Fourteen steps and I arrive right where I want 
to be. But -- if I run or rush, I'll lose count 
and slam into it.


AMY
I'm sorry. Told you - can't leave well enough 
alone. I - I guess I should get back, start to pack...
VIRGIL 
Rushing into trees again?


Off Amy's smile we CUT TO: 

EXT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

On the Porch - the two of them - sipping glasses of wine - we see 
their dinner - Hungry Man beef entree - each category of food in 
it's own perfect little compartment. 

AMY 
You know this dinner - this is really quite...


VIRGIL 
Ordinary? 
(she laughs) 
It's an acquired taste - trust me. 
Jennie thinks it's the only way I'll 
know where my food is. But I have a 
secret weapon.
(holds up a little bottle) 
Hot sauce! Let's you know you're eating 
something - like some.


He starts to sprinkle liberally on Amy's food. Amy, laughing grabs 
the bottle. 
AMY 
That's OK - I'll do it. 
Don't want to overdo it.


She puts the bottle down - looks to Virgil - sips her wine. Time to 
face it. 

AMY 
Virgil - I have to go home tomorrow...


VIRGIL 
Wait, wait - you smell that?


AMY
No - what?


VIRGIL 
The winter pines - it's so strong at 
night - drifts on the wind - wait - 
hear the breeze then...


AMY 
There.


Amy closes her eyes - takes in the scent - and they both sit there - 
close - taking in the night air - enjoying the moment. 

And on Virgil's face we see him lost in thought. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON VIRGIL - eyes closed - we hear a sound - like night 
crickets. His eyes slowly open. 

He rolls over - his arm reaching out for her: 

But there's no one there. Virgil sits upright. 

VIRGIL 
Amy?


Amy is sitting in a chair by the window. 

AMY 
I'm here - trouble sleeping.


VIRGIL
C'mere.


And she crawls back into bed, Virgil takes hold of her and as she 
settles into his arm, he strokes her face gently - a blind man's 
version of watching his lover fall to sleep. 

BLACK - then we hear voices 

INT. VIRGIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING 

CLOSE ON: Amy's face - the voices awaken her - cutting into her 
dreams. 

She looks out the doorway - sees Virgil and Jenny arguing on the 
front porch. She can't hear what they are saying - but it's clear 
there's a problem. 

INT. VIRGIL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 

Amy pulling a robe around herself - comes into the room - as Jenny 
turns on her heel and walks away from Virgil. 

EXT. PORCH - MORNING 

Virgil stands there a moment - taking in what just happened. Amy 
steps out onto the porch. 

AMY 
Everything alright?


VIRGIL 
Yeah, yeah. Morning - Look, 
something I want to say...


AMY 
The leaving thing - I know - hate it too.


VIRGIL
The other night - when we were dancing - 
being with you - I felt different -
special - I don't know - whole.


AMY 
That was whole?


Virgil puts his hand out - she takes it - he turns to her. 

VIRGIL 
(smile) 
Just for a second I felt like I could see 
you - all of you. 
(beat) 
What you said about this Doctor, this eye guy - 
I know how important it is to you...


AMY 
(turns to him) 
Are you sure you want to do this?


VIRGIL 
We're just going to talk to the guy 
- what could it hurt?
Off Amy's smile: 

SMASH TO: 

EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING 

A soaring shot. Amy's car - travelling across the bridge - heading 
towards Manhattan. 

AMY (V.0.) 
You're going to love the city 
- so many things to see.


INT. CAR - MORNING 

Virgil in the passenger seat - windows open - taking in all the 
sounds - new and exciting. Amy watches him as she drives. 

VIRGIL 
(laughing) 
Waitwaitwait - he hasn't said he 
can even do anything yet.


AMY 
I know I just feel good about this. 
(Amy looks to him - sees him feeling 
the light against his face) 
Virgil, before you lost all sight, 
do you remember seeing anything at all? 


VIRGIL 
Yeah, I do. I was just a baby when it 
happened - but there is one thing. 
(beat) 
Something ... puffy. That's all I 
remember about it. Everyone says it's 
""clouds,"" but I know I had it in my hands 
- so it couldn't be clouds. This puffy 
thing - that was something special - 
it's stayed with me all these years - 
I don't know why.


INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY 

DR. RICHARD AARON, wire rims, short, stylish haircut - is finishing 
a high-tech examination of Virgil's eyes. Cups attached to wires sit 
over his eyes. The machine, an ELECTRORETINOGRAM, emits an 
irritating strange flat line sound. The room is very dimly lit. 

Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine - a series of 
flashing lights hit Virgil's eyes. The doctor jots down a reading - 
then with a flourish, spins the machine away from Virgil's face and 
pops a button emitting a detailed computer print out. 

In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr. Goldman - focused on 
papers in his hands. 

AARON 
OK - we're done.


Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to Virgil 
as Amy moves to join them. 

AARON 
Some good news. You have grade 4 
posterior subscapular cataracts.


VIRGIL 
And this is the good news?


AARON
Good news in that I should be able to 
remove them with little or no damage 
to your cornea.


AMY 
So -- what does that mean - 
they're gone - then what?


AARON 
The cataracts are acting like a curtain - 
covering the window of sight. If the disease 
to the retina is reduced as much as I think 
it is - there's a very good possibility 
we can give you sight.


Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive. Virgil's expressionless - taking 
this all in. 

VIRGIL 
Sounds expensive.


AARON 
(looks to Goldman who nods imperceptibly) 
We feel there's an opportunity for us all here - 
I think I can get the institute to pick up the bill.


VIRGIL 
So. Say you remove the cataracts - 
do you have any idea what kind of vision I'd have?


Aaron looks to Goldman. 

AARON 
At this time - no. Unfortunately the 
cataracts are not allowing me to see the 
retinal wall. I can't tell how advanced 
the retinitas pigmentosa has become.
VIRGIL 
So you're suggesting an operation 
that may or may not be successful.


AMY 
But there is a chance he 
could regain his sight.


AARON 
There have been a few cases of restored 
vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth. 
(moves near Virgil) 
The operation is delicate, I'll admit - 
but nothing as invasive as what you went 
through as a child. Of course there is 
always some risks with any operation - 
infection, swelling - long shot stuff. 
I would do both eyes at the same time 
- it's basically out patient surgery.
Virgil - an exhale of air. A lot to take in. 

VIRGIL 
What if it doesn't work? What if I have 
the operation - with all it's risks - 
and you remove the cataract - and it doesn't work.


Aaron looks to Amy. 

AARON 
(somber) 
It would be evident that you will 
never be able to see.


Virgil's head shifts slightly. Not what he wanted to hear. Amy 
reaches out takes his hand. 

AMY 
What do you think?


VIRGIL 
That's what I need - to think.


EXT. AMY'S LOFT - SOHO - DAY 

Virgil and Amy stepping out of a cab. Virgil using his cane - seems 
blinder than we've seen him before. The city sounds an assault on 
him. 

AMY 
This is my place - there's a park 
across the street and...


She stops - realizes he wants to walk in silence. They enter her 
loft building, an old converted industrial space. 

INT. LOFT STAIRWELL - DAY 

There is an odd, loud sound which echoes three times after every 
bounce. As they come up on the second floor landing, a basketball 
comes flying down the hall which Amy fumbles with - then catches. 

AMY 
Ethan!


From around the corner comes ETHAN COLVIN, eight, oversized Knicks 
shirt. Amy tosses him his ball. 

ETHAN 
Sorry - my mom won't let me go 
outside till she gets home from work.


AMY
Well, if the super catches you playing
ball in the hall, he'll have a coronary.


ETHAN 
A what?


AMY 
Never mind. Ethan, 
this is my friend Virgil.


VIRGIL 
Hey, Ethan


ETHAN 
(seeing his cane) 
Are you blind?


VIRGIL 
Yeah.


ETHAN 
Cool. See ya.


And he turns and runs back up the stairs. 

AMY 
(apologetic) 
Virgil...


VIRGIL 
Hey, the kid thinks I'm cool 
- what's so bad.


INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY 

Amy's loft is a wide open space - a KITCHEN facing onto a small 
living area - a BED in the corner of the room - a WORK SPACE with 
DRAFTING BOARD and DRAWING RACKS fill one side of the room. By a 
window stands a plaster SCULPTURE stuck in the corner as if 
forgotten. 

AMY 
This is where I hang my hat 
- it's a bit of a mess but...


Amy stops, realizes he can't see it. Virgil puts his overnight bag 
down. 

VIRGIL 
Now, Blind 101. Help me out with a mental map. 
Walk me down a straight line and show me your 
place, all the obstacles. Remember once you've 
told me, they can't be moved - otherwise...


AMY
Got it - here take my arm. 
(they start about the room) 
Couch, chair, TV to the left, 
low table at.. .at 4 o'clock, 
has the phone on it...


They come to the Sculpture, Virgil's hand grazes across it. 

VIRGIL 
What's this?


AMY 
Nothing. A sculpture.


VIRGIL 
It's yours?


AMY 
My art school days - not very good.


Virgil continues to feel the sculpture from top to bottom, not 
stopping during the dialogue. 

VIRGIL 
It's a mother? - holding her child - up in the air 
- like she's proud? It's beautiful.


AMY
It's not done yet - 
one day I'll finish it.


Virgil turns - his hand to the wall - feels a window: 

VIRGIL 
Does this window open? 
I could use some air.


AMY 
(moving to the windows) 
I think so.


As Amy throws open the window, a wind blasts through - catching a 
stack of plans on her drafting table - blowing them across the 
floor. 

AMY 
Damn!


Virgil turns, concerned, makes his way to her. 

VIRGIL 
What happened?


AMY 
The wind - knocked over my plans.


Amy down on the floor picking them up - Virgil senses her down there 
- crouches down beside her - tries to help her pick up. 

VIRGIL 
What is this - these plans?


Amy looks at Virgil - - his hand running across one of her plans. 

AMY 
Just my work - - some plans for the Atlanta 
project we're bidding on - drawings of a lobby 
we're finishing up, some other smaller stuff. 
It's -- it's what I do.


Amy realizes they mean nothing to him - he hands them back - stands. 
She watches him - then standing, moves to him. 

AMY 
I've got to get to work. Tonight we'll do something 
- we could listen to music or go out for dinner...


VIRGIL 
How about a movie?


AMY 
A movie?


VIRGIL 
Yeah. I haven't been in years.


AMY
Alright. A movie. I won't be long.


And Amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for the door - a beat - 
she forgets her purse - steps back in to see: 

Virgil standing there quietly - his hand out on her plans again - 
feeling the paper - searching for the design - wanting to know her - 
wanting to understand her - finding nothing there. 

Amy feels uncomfortable - quietly steps out - closes the door. 

INT. REVIVAL THEATER - NIGHT 

WIDE - the theater half full playing Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" the 
very funny scene where Woody and Diane Keaton wrestle with the 
lobster. 

We move in slowly and discover Virgil and Amy leaning in close to 
each other - Amy quietly describing the scene to him. 

AMY 
There's these big pots and Woody's got 
a huge lobster in his hand...


VIRGIL 
Lobster - what's a lobster?


AMY 
(trying not to use her hands to describe) 
It's a.. .kind of like.. it's got...


Then she looks to Virgil - sees he was kidding her. 

AMY 
(laughing) 
That's it - you're on your own.


Off Virgil's laugh: 

INT. SUBWAY LINE - NIGHT 

BWAM - a subway train explodes past us. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

A collection of typical night riders - everyone keeping to 
themselves. Two kids sit in the corner - blasting their boom box 
Virgil stands in the middle of the train - enjoying the vibrations. 
Amy sits on a seat watching him. 

VIRGIL 
And they lived happily ever after.


AMY 
Woody and Diane...


VIRGIL 
And the lobster?
AMY 
Stop with the lobster. 

A song comes on the radio - Virgil's head turns. 

VIRGIL 
Hey - you here that?


All she hears is the clatter of the subway. 

AMY 
What?


Virgil turns towards the music - BAPPING his hands rhythmically on 
the subway car wall. 

VIRGIL 
Hey - can you turn that up?


The KID shrugs - CRAKKS it up. It's Gershwin's ""Can't take that Away 
from Me."" Virgil turns to Amy - picks up on the song - hands RAPPING 
- he starts singing: 

VIRGIL 
""The way you comb your hair, 
The way you sip your tea...""


He finds Amy, pulls her up and into an embrace as he saunters them 
down the aisle. 

AMY 
Virgil?!


VIRGIL 
(loudly) 
""Can't take that away from meee"" - what?


AMY 
People are watching.


VIRGIL 
Watching? Watching what?


AMY
You. Me. Everyone is staring at us.


VIRGIL 
And?


AMY 
Well - it can be embarrassing.


VIRGIL 
(kidding) 
Oh - I see.


AMY 
No - you don't.


VIRGIL Touche. 
""The way you make me see...""


AMY
(turns to him) 
What do you mean?! 
(Virgil gives her a look - 
I want the operation) 
You mean it. I mean I only want 
you to have the operation...


VIRGIL 
Amy. I want the chance to see. 
The chance to see Central Park, 
the Brooklyn Bridge, apples, raisins,
a buffalo, a carbuerator and the man 
in the moon. 
(beat) 
But I would give all that up - 
just to see this face.


And Amy folds herself into Virgil - a moment - they hold each other 
- then - Amy starts to sing along with the song - Virgil joining in 
- and they dance - together - in love. 

SMASH CUT TO: 

EXT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

AMY/VIRGIL (V.0.) 
""You can't take that away from me.""


And the car explodes past again - and as the music dies we cut to: 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM 

CLOSE ON: a platter of silver utensils - fine, exacting scalpels. A 
gloved HAND comes into frame - picks up a clamp - and we follow it 
to: 

VIRGIL'S EYES - the clamp being used to hold it open. The work we 
are seeing is grueling - difficult to watch - but at the same time 
so fascinating it is hard to take our eyes off. 

Dr. Aaron followed by Dr. Goldman - hands in the air - mask on - 
leans over Virgil - looks to the ANESTHESIOLOGIST who nods - then to 
no one in particular. 

AARON 
OK Virgil - let's get to it.


And as he is handed a SCALPEL, we watch as it moves down to cut open 
the white section of the eye - and just as it feels almost 
unbearable to watch- - 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY 

We see Amy, coffee cup in hand, grab a second just poured cup out of 
a vending machine. She makes her way over to reveal Jennie who sits 
quietly reading a book. 

AMY 
Coffee? It's really bad. 

Jennie looks up - smiles takes the cup. Amy sits down next to her. 
They both sip for a moment. 

AMY 
Virgil never mentions his parents 
- do they know? 

JENNIE 
Our mother died when I was 20 - Virgil wasn't
even a teenager. And our father - he's been 
gone for quite awhile. 

AMY 
I'm sorry. I didn't know. 

Jennie looks into her coffee - takes another sip. 

JENNIE 
(smile) 
You're right this is bad.


AMY 
It must have been very tough on you 
- taking care of Virgil alone after 
your mother died.


JENNIE 
He's my brother.


Simple. 

AMY 
You don't like Virgil 
doing this - do you?


JENNIE 
I don't like Virgil getting hurt. 
Hope is like fire, it can keep you 
warm - - or it can burn you.


INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY 

Dr. Aaron: - focused on his exacting work. His hands move deftly. 

CLOSE ON: Virgil's eye. Cut open. Aaron's probe working right in the 
middle of it. 

DR. AARON 
There you are.


And Aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue - holding it up for 
all to see - before he PLOPS it on a tray. Switching instruments - 
he gingerly picks up a plastic implant - moving back towards the eye 
- he glances at the nurse assisting him: 

DR. AARON 
You know what they say, Virgil? 
The eyes are the windows to the soul.


Virgil can't move - listens intently as he carefully places the 
implant into Virgil's eye. 

DR. AARON 
(with a wink) 
That makes us the Windex to the soul. 
(he focuses) 
OK, both eyes done. Let's patch him up.


On a large monitor we see an EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Virgil's eye - 
waiting. 

INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - LATER 

Virgil being wheeled down a hall - head wrapped in bandages. 

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 

As he enters: 

VIRGIL 
Hello?


Jennie's there - takes his hand. 

VIRGIL 
Jennie?


JENNIE
How're you feeling?


VIRGIL
OK - a little pain, 
like a tequila hang over
- is Amy here?


AMY 
Right here - Dr. Aaron said you did great


VIRGIL 
So how's my hair - I'd hate the first time 
I see myself to be a bad hair day. 
(Virgil reacts to a sound) 
What's that?
AMY 
There's camera guys here too.


WIDE - we now see the room has a small VIDEO CREW in it preparing to 
document the event. 

VIRGIL 
Camera guys?


AARON 
(entering) 
For posterity. We're going to make you
famous. We're also sending this closed 
circuit to one of our conference rooms 
- there's a lot of people interested in 
our results today. So how you feel Virgil?


VIRGIL 
Good. Great. Fine. 
(a laugh) 
Nervous.


Aaron moves about the room closing blinds to let in just a few slats 
of light. 
AARON 
Nothing to be nervous about. 
Now Jennie and Amy, if you would 
stand off to my right -- I want 
Virgil to get just a slight bounce 
of light.
(returning to Virgil) 
Ready Virgil.


VIRGIL 
Let's go.


Both Amy and Jennie subconsciously adjust their hair as Aaron starts 
to unravel the bandages. 

When the bandages are completely off - all that is left are two 
gauze patches on both eyes. 

AARON 
Okay - last phase - 
we remove these patches and...


VIRGIL
(suddenly apprehensive, hand up) 
Okay - wait. So - so - what do I do? 
I mean, what will I see first?


AARON
Well - we're all here - Amy, 
your sister. This is new for 
us all. Why don't we find out?


Aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches from his eyes - and 
everyone waits. 

Virgil slowly opens his eyes - he just seems to be staring blankly, 
bewildered - not focusing at Aaron who stands before him, still 
holding the bandages. 

Amy looks to Jennie - to Aaron - what's happening? Then finally: 

AARON 
Well?


And Virgil reacts - a startling look of recognition mixed with fear 
crossing his face. 

AMY 
What is it Virgil?


VIRGIL 
It's - it's - I don't know.


And now for the first time we see Virgil's POV: 

There is light, movement, color, shadow - but somehow it is foreign 
to us. There is no perception of depth -. no sense of definition of 
shape or shadow - it is as confounding to us as it is to Virgil - 
like an explosion of Picasso, Dali and Monet on screen. 

Suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images - there is movement - 
and a voice emits out of what we now for the first time recognize as 
a mouth. Dr. Aaron speaks again - leaning in to Virgil, who reacts 
back. 

AARON 
Virgil - what do you see?


VIRGIL 
Something's wrong.


Jennie's reaction comes pouring out of her eyes in tears, first 
slowly, then a dam break. 

AMY 
Virgil what's wrong?
What's happening?


AARON 
Everything's fine - 
it's going to take...


JENNIE
It's not fine - 
don't say it's fine.


AARON 
Tell me what you're seeing Virgil.


Virgil suddenly pulling back - his eyes dancing around in his head - 
trying to take it all in - trying to focus. 

VIRGIL 
(over everyone) 
I don't know - it's all screwed up - 
this can't be seeing - something's wrong
- too confusing - what the hell's happening??!


HIS POV - the camera crew coming toward him for a closer shot - it's 
like a giant monster violently moving towards us! 

VIRGIL 
What is it - Stop!


Virgil's hand lashes out towards the camera crew - even though they 
are 15 feet away. 

AARON 
What? The camera?


JENNIE 
(to the crew) 
Stop moving!


AMY
Virgil, it's just the camera.


The room has heightened into chaos - Virgil reacting to everything 
he sees, any quick movement - Amy moves next to him - Aaron trying 
to remain calm - Jennie assuring Virgil everything's OK. 

AARON 
Alright - alright - they've stopped. 
OK. Let's everybody just calm down 
- we'll take it slowly.


Everyone settles - takes a breath. 

AMY 
Virgil. What can we do?


They all look to Virgil - breathing heavy - his eyes swinging back 
and forth. 

VIRGIL 
I gotta focus - gotta think - 
gimme a second - OK, OK - get me a 
coke. Somebody?


JENNIE
He's thirsty - someone get him a drink!!


VIRGIL
No - just a can - a bottle -- 
put something in my hands!


Amy reaches over - grabs an empty coke can. 

AMY 
Here - how's this?


Virgil takes it in his hands - closes his eyes - feels it. Then 
slowly opens his eyes - trying to focus on what is in his hand - 
Aaron catching on. 

AARON 
Good, Virgil - that's it - use your touch - 
associate - now, tell me - what do you see 
in your hand?


Long moment. Virgil holds it up - stares hard. 

VIRGIL 
A can. Is it a can?


JENNIE 
What's going on?


They all look at Virgil turning the can over and over in his hand - 
staring intently at it - learning it. 

AARON 
(beams) He's associating - one sense to the other. 
His fingers tell his brain - then his brain 
tells his eyes and he recognizes the image 
in front of him. 
(realizing) 
He's seeing!


Aaron looks to Amy and Jennie - they're still doubtful - he motions 
to them to meet him outside. 

AARON 
Virgil - let's rest your eyes for today and 
we'll check them again tomorrow. We should
all be happy - we've got something.


Virgil: not happy, just very confused. As Aaron leaves, Jennie takes 
Virgil's hand while Amy stands there upset - watching him just 
staring at a Soda Can. 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - DAY 

In the corridor, Dr. Aaron shaking hands with Dr. Goldman - people 
exiting the near-by conference room all congratulating the two 
doctors. As Amy exits the room - Aaron moves to her. 

AMY
What just happened in there?


AARON 
You saw it. Success.


AMY 
Success - wait a minute - then why can't 
he see me, his sister, anything.


AARON
He sees you. He just doesn't 
understand that he sees you.


AMY 
But he'll overcome it - I mean - 
this is temporary right?


AARON 
There's a very real possibility the 
part of his brain area allocated to 
vision is atrophied - given it's lack 
of use, Virgil has probably used it 
for some other function.


Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has just heard Aaron. 

JENNIE
You didn't think of this?


This is as much an accusation of Amy as of Aaron. 

AARON 
We had no way of knowing what his faculties 
were until we gave him the operation. If you 
remember - we didn't know what to expect 
- though it's clear his retinal disease must 
be in remission.


AMY
So what are we supposed to do now - 
you saw him - it's like he's another 
person in there.


AARON
He won't need to stay here - take him home 
- let him rest. But I will need to see him 
every couple of days for the next month. 


AMY 
Isn't there some kind of therapy 
he should be doing - someone to help him.


Aaron stares at her - hadn't thought of this. 
AARON
OK, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster 
- a little unorthodox - that's why he's probably 
your best bet, especially considering the unique 
aspects of Virgil's condition. I'll contact 
him for you - but there's no guarantee he can help.


JENNIE 
(can't believe this) 
No guarantees.
AARON
Jennie, I told Amy here when we first talked - this is whole 
new ground - for all of us.


And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into Virgil's room. Amy just 
stares at Dr. Aaron - a little overwhelmed. 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CHANGE AREA - DAY 

Virgil - starting to dress. He stares at his clothes on a hangar - 
not comprehending what it is. He closes his eyes - his hand going 
out to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes the shirt turns - 
and notices someone watching him. 

VIRGIL 
Hello?


HIS POV - it's his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes. 
Virgil stares at himself standing stock still - waiting for a 
response from the person staring at him. 
VIRGIL
Is there...?


Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself. He starts moving 
towards the mirror fascinated. 

Virgil's POV - Focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape - 
becomes clearer to him. His hand going up to his nose - moving it 
back and forth - laughs at it's absurdity - then is taken with his 
own smile. He tries a smile - comes off awkward as he starts to 
stare at his teeth. Touching each part of his face he investigates 
his chin, ears and finally his hair. 

Then he stops - and just stares - and stares at a face that is his 
own - but so incredibly foreign to him. Who is this person? 

INT. VIRGIL'S ROOM - DAY 

Jenny starting to pack up Virgil's things. Suddenly there is a burst 
of laughter from the other room. She looks up quizzically 

INT. HOSPITAL CHECK-OUT - DAY 

Amy in the check-in area - pacing - on a cellphone. 

AMY 
Duncan - I know the additions to the mall will 
cost more.. look, I can't do this on the phone 
- I'll be in tomorrow.. yes, I remembered they're 
putting the fixtures in the lobby - I'll get 
there as well - I'm just asking for one more day.


INT. WAITING AREA - DAY 

Jenny - finishing packing up Virgil's things. 

VIRGIL (V.O.) 
Amy?


Jenny looks up - Virgil standing in the doorway, dressed. 

JENNIE 
No - it's Jennie.


She moves toward him - Virgil pulls back - hands out in front of 
him. 

JENNIE 
I'm sorry - I'll move slower - I just...


And Virgil's hands are on her face - eyes closed - feeling. He opens 
his eyes - staring blankly - trying to figure this out. 

VIRGIL 
This is you.


JENNIE 
This is me.


INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY 

Angle on Amy moving down the hall - hearing the voices. 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

JENNIE 
Everything's going to be alright 
- we just need to get you home.


VIRGIL 
No, no - I can't go home. 
I need to be here - see the therapist
- doctor's. I want to be here.


JENNIE
But I can't stay here - and you can't 
do this alone--who's going to take care.. .?


She stops. Realizing. 

ANGLE On Amy - outside the door - not wanting to go in. 

JENNIE 
Amy? She's going to look after you? 
She doesn't know anything about the blind.


VIRGIL
I'm not blind anymore - and I'm not 
going to let someone I care about 
walk out of my life again.


JENNIE
(moves to him) 
It's not your fault he left. 
You can't keep blaming yourself.


VIRGIL 
(beat) 
I'm staying here.


A pause - and Jennie moves her hand out to him - touches his arm. 

INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

Amy feeling uncomfortable - starts to step away. 

JENNIE (O.S.)
Amy?


Amy turns - Jennie in the doorway. 

JENNIE 
Virgil's finishing getting ready. 
Could you walk me to my car?


Amy nods - sees an element of defeat in Jennie's eyes. 

EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE DAY 

Jennie and Amy stand on the curb near Jennie's car. A moment of 
uncomfortableness - then: 

AMY 
You alright? 

JENNIE 
I'm scared to death. I've spent my whole life 
looking for any holes he might fall in. 
I'd run up ahead and cover them. Everywhere
I look here, I see holes.


AMY 
Please believe me - I don't want him 
to get hurt anymore than you do.


JENNIE 
Amy - when Virgil was very young, he couldn't 
see those close to him - so he never learned 
to reach out. 
(turns to her) Don't expect him to reach out when he's in pain,
or confused, or unhappy. If you really care 
about him you have to just be there for him.


And before Amy can answer, she gets into her car - starts it up and 
drives off. 

EXT/INT AMY'S.LOFT - DUSK 

Virgil slowly gets out of the cab, looks up at the buildings - 
immediately gets dizzy and nearly falls over. Amy lunges to help 
him. Virgil is laughing in spite of himself. 

VIRGIL 
This is just great - I don't believe this. 
What's that saying - stop the world I wanna get off.


ETHAN (O.S.) 
Hey Virgil, it's Ethan.


Virgil turns to the familiar voice. Ethan, basketball under his arm, 
coming out of the building with his Mom, KAREN COLVIN. Virgil scans, 
tries to focus on them. 

VIRGIL 
That you Ethan?


ETHAN 
It's me - and this is my mom.


AMY 
Virgil - Karen.


KAREN 
Hi, Virgil - heard a lot about you.


ETHAN 
You look funny.


VIRGIL 
You should see how I look from this side.


AMY Let's just get you inside - 
then you can rest. 
We'll see you later Ethan. Karen.


And she gives Karen a small glance as she takes Virgil's arm as they 
start towards the stairs leading into the building - Virgil suddenly 
slamming to a halt. 

VIRGIL 
Wait, wait, what are we doing 
- WE'RE WALKING INTO A WALL!!


Virgil's POV - the staircase. A flat image - a solid wall with 
horizontal lines. Ethan, surprised, what's up here? 

AMY 
It's OK - it's not a wall - 
it's just a staircase. You're 
going to have to trust me on 
these things.


VIRGIL
God, I feel like... like such a child - 
I just thought seeing would be different.


AMY 
We'll get a hold of this Ray Webster guy
- we'll get his help.


Virgil steps slowly forward - giant baby steps - each foot reaching 
out to feel the step before making the commitment. 

HIS POV - the 'wall' of stairs changing perspective with each step. 
Like an accordion spreading itself out to us. This is all a very bad 
acid trip. 

INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK 

VIRGIL'S POV - multi-colored balloons, dozens of assorted flowers, 
bowls of colorful fruit and streamers intertwined across the room. A 
candyland of seeing. 

VIRGIL 
Man. Something exploded 
in your apartment.


Amy laughs - pulls him into the room. Virgil trying to take it all 
in - not understanding anything. 

AMY 
I wanted to do something 
special for you.


VIRGIL 
It's making me a little 
bit dizzy - but it is special.


Virgil's hands go out - Amy moves to him - he holds her shoulders. 
He stares at her. 

As she turns her head slightly, Virgil is able to focus on her - her 
eyes - her smile. 

VIRGIL 
Okay - so - this is what 
beautiful looks like.


AMY 
Thank-you. You want to
see the rest.
Focusing on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans 
in and kisses her. She pulls back a little. 
AMY 
I can't believe this 
- how nervous I am.


She kisses him then takes a step back. 

AMY 
What if you don't like what you see?


VIRGIL 
Do you want me to turn off the lights?


AMY
No - no. This is your first seeing day. 
(she starts to unbutton her dress) 
I want you to see everything.


And she drops the dress from her shoulders - it hits the ground - a 
beat - and she stands there naked. 

AMY 
OK?


VIRGIL 
Yes, very OK.


And she takes a step towards him and folds into his arms and as they 
kiss we slowly fade to black. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

The sound of heavy New York rain. Amy awakening, and sees Virgil is 
gone, his side of the bed empty. She looks across the room - where 
she sees silhouetted against the moonlit window - - Virgil standing 
next to Amy's sculpture, his face and body pressed up against the 
pane of glass. 

AMY 
(wrapping a house coat around her) 
Virgil?


Virgil turns around - half faces her - the rain on the windows 
decorating his face. 

VIRGIL 
I can't sleep - I'm afraid if I close my eyes...


AMY 
It'll be black when you open them again.


Virgil nods. A moment and his hand goes out to her sculpture. 

VIRGIL 
You enjoy sculpting?


AMY 
At first. I liked the idea of molding - 
taking the way I saw things up here- - 
(touching her head) 
- and making it take shape with my hands.


VIRGIL 
But you never finish them.


AMY 
Pieces never come out the way I wanted 
- the way I saw them. I end up working 
on them forever - like this one - 
never getting them right.


Virgil stares out the window at the rain. 

VIRGIL 
This is what rain looks like?


AMY 
Yeah.


VIRGIL 
It looks lonely. Not what I expected. 
But I like it.


Amy smiles - moves into him as he pulls her in close and they look 
out at the night rain. 

INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT - DAY 

Amy working over a CAD computer with & draftsman. 

AMY 
You've got to alter each of 
the windows by five feet...


DRAFTSMAN 
These are the specs you gave me.


AMY 
I know - I'm changing them - 
this is better. 
(calling out) 
Betsy!


Betsy pokes her head in. 

AMY 
Can you get me some research on 
those Maple trees we're leaving in. 
They're too big - I want to change 
them so they fit in with the design 
better. Get rid of the dead weight.


BETSY 
Don't you have an appointment?


Amy looks to her watch. Starts for her jacket and the door. 

AMY 
Yes, yes. Thank-you. 
Evan here will print out the new specs 
- give them to Duncan - tell him I'll
be back in two hours.


DUNCAN (O.S.) 
Amy?


Duncan steps out of his office. She turns - virtually out the door. 

AMY 
Just give me two hours.


And she's gone. 

EXT. NYU CAMPUS - NEXT DAY 

A few KIDS smoking on the steps. Others entering, laden down with 
books - a small sea parting to allow Amy helping Virgil up the steps 
and inside. 

INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY 

They make their way down the hall - past a - room where a group of 
BLIND CHILDREN learn to read Braille. Amy can't help but stare at 
these young faces struggling to learn. It's a whole different world. 

INT. RAY WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY 

A strange space, dark, as all the windows are covered. In a jar on 
the desk - two pickled eyeballs stare back at Virgil and Amy waiting 
patiently. There are books everywhere - periodicals stacked and 
overflowing on shelves. A dead plant in the corner. 

RAY WEBSTER - 60's, almost completely bald, wearing a worn NYU 
sweatshirt, sits at the desk in front of them - flipping through a 
file in front of him. 

WEBSTER 
Right - OK, Virgil - says here you went 
blind at one - before you developed a 
visual vocabulary. 
(Webster stands - moves towards a bookshelf) 
You have no sense of depth of field, 
no knowledge of space, shape, size or 
distance. Basically your eyes work but 
your brain hasn't learned to process 
the information. 
(beat) 
You are mentallv blind. Neurologists 
call this ""visual agnosia"".


VIRGIL 
I call it pretty screwed up.


WEBSTER 
Better term. I'll make a note of that.


Webster plops down a large book - flips through some pages, then 
searching his pockets: 

WEBSTER 
Dammit


AMY 
What?


WEBSTER 
Glasses, can never find 'em. 
(calling out) 
Mrs. Fenster.


Mrs. Fenster pops her head in the door - this must be a ritual they 
have as she instantly pulls her GLASSES off and hands them to 
Webster who drops them over his nose. They are clearly woman's 
glasses - pointed in the ends - little jewels. As Mrs. Fenster 
leaves. 

WEBSTER 
(referring to the book) 
OK. Alberto Valvo ""Sight Restoration after 
Long Term Blindness"" - blah-blah-blah. -
ah here... 
(reading) 
""One must die as a blind person to be born
again as a sighted person. However it is 
the interim, the limbo- -between two worlds,
one dead/the other powerless to be born - 
that is so terrible."" 
(slamming the book shut) 
There. You're in limbo.


AMY 
What do you mean - there - he's in limbo.
That's all you have to offer?


WEBSTER
What? - I'm Anne Bancroft all of a sudden? 
I'm a professor - I teach people, how to 
teach the blind how to become independent. 
(beat) 
There's no book on what you're going through
- I'd like to help - but like the rest of 
things in life - it's up to you.


VIRGIL
Wait a minute - up to me? 
I thought you were going to help me here.


Webster rummages in his desk - pulls out a magazine photo - then 
digging in a brown paper bag - he pulls out an apple. 

WEBSTER 
You want a lesson? Right - here. 
What's this?


He holds out the apple for Virgil - who reluctantly takes it - holds 
it in his hand, eyes closed, feels it - then opening his eyes he 
holds it out in front of him, trying to focus on it. 

HIS POV - as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape. 

VIRGIL 
It's an apple.


WEBSTER 
Good. Good. 
(holding up the photo) 
OK. What's this now?


Virgil stares at the photo. HIS POV - a photo of -- an APPLE. Not 
that different from the real apple he holds in his hand - he holds 
the real apple up to compare - using his eyes. 

VIRGIL 
It's an apple.


WEBSTER 
(holding the paper out to Virgil) 
Good. Good. But is it an apple or 
just a picture of an apple?


And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes - it's not an apple 
- just a representation of one. Virgil is visibly disappointed. 

VIRGIL 
So this is a joke? Is that what you're
saying - your eyes lie to you? Great 
- looking forward to this.


WEBSTER 
Your eyesight can and will play tricks on 
you Virgil. Remember that. No matter what
I could teach you - no matter what exercises 
I could give you - they'll still play tricks on you.


VIRGIL
That's all it is right now - one big trick. 
Nothing makes any sense. I can't function like this.


WEBSTER
(he moves to his chair) 
Virgil - look - you have to learn to see - 
just like you learned to speak. Only this 
is not like learning a new language - 
it's like learning language for the first time. 
(he leans forward) 
Perception - sight - life, is about experience 
- about reaching out and exploring the world 
for yourself. It's not enough to just see Virgil -- 
(he points two fingers into his eyes) 
-- we've got to look as well.


And Webster turns the fingers from his eyes outward - to the world. 

AMY 
(wound up) 
Well, thank-you Obi Wan Kenobi - 
but that doesn't tell us anything. 
What we need is some assistance here 
- some kind of program - a set of exercises 
- we're kind of adrift and...


WEBSTER 
Amy - last I checked - this isn't a game 
of Parcheesi, it doesn't come with a set of rules.


AMY 
I can't believe you're just...


VIRGIL
Amy. Let's go.


AMY 
No, wait, Virgil...


VIRGIL 
Let's go. 
(standing) 
Thank-you Dr. Webster.


WEBSTER 
You want me - I'm always here.


And Virgil turns and half steps - half shuffles towards the door. We 
hold on Amy's befuddled face - then: 

EXT. NYU - DAY 

Virgil feels his way down the steps - Amy rushing out after him. 

AMY 
I'm going to call Aaron - 
get him to recommend someone else.


VIRGIL 
He's right, Amy. I've got to do this 
on my own. No one taught you how to see.


Virgil starts walking stiffly towards the street. Amy hurries after 
him - grabs him just as he was about to step into traffic. 

AMY 
I was a baby then - I had years to learn - 
you don't - you need to...
(anxious) --we don't even know what to do 
- where to start..


Virgil's hand goes out - brushes a mailbox. 

VIRGIL 
What's this - this thing?


Amy looks over. 

AMY 
(shrugs) 
What - it's a mailbox.


VIRGIL 
What color is it?


AMY
Blue.


Virgil stares at it - tries to take it in. 

VIRGIL
Blue. OK, good - that's a mailbox
- it's blue. There - we've started.


She says nothing. Virgil senses her apprehension. 

AMY Let's just get a cab, get you home 
- and tonight we can work on it.
(hand out) 
Cab!


A cab veers across traffic - pulls up to them. 

VIRGIL 
I want to walk. I want to see what's out there.


AMY
Fine. Let's walk.


VIRGIL 
Don't you have a job?


AMY 
I'm going to make time for this. I promise.


VIRGIL 
Go to work. If I need you - 
I have your number.


A beat, she looks to Virgil then climbs into the cab and it pulls 
away. 

Virgil looks left, right - trying to decide where to start his 
journey when we see the cab back up in front of him and Amy climbs 
out. 

AMY 
Screw work - let's go try those eyes.


INT. LECTURE RALL - DAY 

Aaron at a podium. The room filled with colleagues. A NEWSCREW 
records the lecture from the back of the hall. 

AARON 
Now just two weeks after surgery--the patient is 
still having difficulty understanding images,
shapes, contours - 

EXT. NY CITY STREET - NEW DAY 

Virgil - determined to see - making his way down a street - trying 
to dodge people coming at him from all angles. Amy walks a short 
distance behind him - coaxing him along. 

HIS POV - people seem to explode out of two dimensions into three. 
This is clearly exhausting. 

AARON (CONT.)
- and his progress with depth of field has been especially slow...


WHAM - Virgil collides with a kid on a skateboard - Amy winces as he 
quickly regains his balance - shakes it off - starts his journey 
again - determined. 

EXT. BROADWAY - STREET VNNDORS - DAY 

Amy trying to help Virgil take in the confusion of images - 
explaining to him items hanging about the stalls. It's clear he's a 
little overwhelmed - when something familiar catches his eye. He 
moves toward it: 

HIS POV - focusing - trying to give it shape - it's a YELLOW CAB - 
just like the one Amy drove off in - again he focuses - reaches out 
- surprisingly wrapping his hand around the car. 

AARON (CONT.)
Virgil is still very reliant on his touch 
to interpret objects in his surroundings -


He then realizes it's a porcelain toy from a souvenir shop. Amy 
watches him examine it like a child as we hear: 

EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY 

AARON (CONT.)
- and his understanding of three dimensionality 
is extremely limited and confounding to him...


Virgil - his hands all over a small long haired TERRIER. He looks to 
Amy as he stands. 

VIRGIL 
It's a dog.


Amy on her cellphone - trying to get work done - nods - yes that's a 
dog. Virgil looks back at the pup - which has now turned around 
backwards. 

VIRGIL 
Now what's that?


On Amy - disturbed by his slow progress. 

EXT. GARDEN MARKET - ANOTHER DAY 

Amy and Virgil being led through a series of plants and trees by a 
EARTHY SALESWOMAN. 

SALESWOMAN 
I believe we have just the tree you're 
looking for your lobby. Needs very little 
light - slow growing - ah here we are...


Amy and Virgil stop at a large Ficus Tree. 

AMY 
Nice. Good. What do you think Virgil?


AARON (CONT)
He is also still having great difficulty 
""scanning"", basically putting a whole picture together.


Virgil stares at the large tree. Up - down - up - down - up - down - 
up - down - Amy and the Saleswoman watch him, Amy wants to help but 
can't comprehend what he's going through. 

AARON (CONT.) 
If he looks at the top of a tree - then scans 
to the bottom - he's forgotten the top by the 
time he reaches the trunk.


INT. AMY'S WORK - DAY 

ANGLE ON Virgil in Amy's office - staring at a construction sign - 
FUTURE HOME OF etc... Using his finger to outline the letters of the 
sign - he tries to read the word FUTURE. He mouths the letters - 
tries to form the word. 

AARON (CONT) 
This includes the ability to read. In reading a 
word - he forgets the first letter by the time 
he gets to the last.


Amy working with a draftsman - glances up to see Virgil struggling 
with reading. 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - LECTURE ROOM - DAY 

Bathed in a bank of lights, Aaron at the podium continuing. Virgil 
quiet - is seated behind him. 

AARON (CONT)
-- meaning ... he has a total lack of visual 
memory. This is an unexpected physiological 
flaw. We are hopeful Virgil can overcome this. 
(beat) 
Thank-you - that's all for today.


INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY 

Virgil and Amy exit the hall, are immediately surrounded by 
REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. There's a sudden FLASH. Virgil reacts, 
pulling away. 

VIRGIL 
What's that?


AMY 
A camera - it's OK - 
taking your - picture.


VIRGIL 
What, by flashing me in the face?


FLASH - there's another - Amy tries to block the light. 

AMY 
Please!! - It's not good for him.


Suddenly - there's a mike in his face, as CHRISTIE EVANS reporter 
from Channel 2 news steps forward with CAMERA CREW in tow. 

CHRISTIE EVANS 
Mr. Anderson. Christie Evans Eyewitness news. 
We heard the Doctor speak about your progress 
- and we're wondering what your expectations are.


As Virgil stops - stunned by the lights in his face. As he looks to 
Amy we cut to: 

INT. HOME - LATE DAY 

TV MONITOR - Virgil turns to camera - starts talking to the 
reporter. As we pull back we hear less and less as we reveal a 
modest living room. A TEENAGER doing homework on a table in the 
corner and a MAN - early 60's, rugged - sitting on a couch watching 
the news. 

MAN 
Oh my God.


He leans forward - his interest piqued and he picks up the phone. 

MAN 
Information. Pinecrest. 
For a Jennie Anderson..


INT. RESTAURANT - LITTTE ITALY - LATER THAT NIGHT 

A silver fork held up in front of us. 

AMY 
What's this?


Virgil and Amy sit on the patio of La Mela. Virgil's hand goes out 
for the fork. Amy pulls it away. 

AMY 
Uh uh uh. See it first. 
No cheating. Concentrate.


Virgil stares hard at it. 

VIRGIL 
(guessing) 
A pen. I don't know - let me touch it.


She hands it to him. 

VIRGIL 
A fork.


AMY 
Right.. Now put it down in 
front of you. How far is it from.


VIRGIL 
Twenty feet


AMY 
You're not looking.


VIRGIL 
Dammit, Amy, Amy, I spent all day in front 
of that panel feeling like a guinea pig. 
Every time I open my eyes I have to look. 
Can we just sit and have dinner for once?


Amy just stares. It's clear they're both tired. 
AMY 
I'm just trying to help you see.


VIRGIL 
I know. But that's all it seems we're 
about. How was your day - what goes on 
at work - how about those Rangers - 
did the stock market hold today - 
is there anything else going on in our 
world besides my eyes?


AMY 
(beat) 
OK, we've been invited to a party 
- Duncan's birthday.


An ITALIAN WAITER appears - putting a large plate of spaghetti in 
front of Virgil and Amy. Virgil is a little repulsed by what he 
sees. 

VIRGIL 
What's this - looks like worms.


AMY 
It's spaghetti - it's fine.


As Virgil tries to maneuver his fork - Amy reaches behind her. 

AMY 
I brought you a present - 
good for hand eye coordination.


She hands him a TOYS R US bag. He peers inside. 

VIRGIL 
Great - you go to work building buildings 
- I go home with building blocks.


INT. ROSWELL -TREMONT - LATE DAY 

Amy - looking a little worn - staring blankly at her computer. A 
three dimensional rendition of the mall rotates on the screen. 
Duncan pokes his head in. 

DUNCAN 
I'm here for you to wish me 
happy birthday. How's it going?


AMY 
(distracted) 
OK. He's progressing, slowly 
- doing the best he can.


DUNCAN 
I was actually wondering about the mall 
designs. We're expected in Atlanta tomorrow 
- with these plans.


AMY 
I can't go to Atlanta tomorrow 
- not with Virgil's problems,..


DUNCAN 
Ok, ok 
(Duncan moves in behind her) 
I'm sorry. Things aren't going so well?


AMY 
(stares at her work) 
He seems blinder now than he ever was.


Duncan puts his hands on her shoulders - starts to knead them. Amy 
starts to relax. 

AMY 
Do you ever wonder why 
you do the things you do?


DUNCAN 
Didn't get what you expected did you? 

AMY 
Sometimes I think he's not going to make it 
- that he's never going to be able to see.


DUNCAN 
Amy - listen to me. You liked this guy 
- I saw that. You wanted to help him 
- it didn't work out so hot. You can't 
punish yourself.. Sometimes things just 
don't work out the way we want them to 
- look at us.


Amy smiles warmly. 

AMY 
Yeah. Thanks Duncan.


DUNCAN 
Anytime. 
(beat, a joke) 
Now back to work.


As he starts out of the room, Amy turns stops him. 
AMY 
Hey, Happy Birthday.


INT. AMY'S LOFT - DAY 

Virgil sits at the kitchen table staring at everyday kitchen 
utensils - being held by Ethan. 

VIRGIL 
Measuring cup?


Ethan shakes his head - no - it's a cheese grater. Virgil stares 
again. Ethan mimes grating cheese. 

VIRGIL 
Cheese grater.


ETHAN 
Yes - my man.


Ethan holds up something new - one of those strange spaghetti 
strainers. Now they are both staring at something they don't 
understand. Virgil looks to Ethan. 

ETHAN 
Got me.


VIRGIL 
(laughing) 
You're no help. How am I supposed 
to do my homework if...


ETHAN 
Homework - dude - I
ain't doin' homework.


Virgil continues to look at the strainer as Ethan gravitates towards 
his cane folded up on the table. 

ETHAN 
(beat) 
You're lucky you got a cane.


Virgil looks over - sees his fascination. 

VIRGIL 
You want it. I've been thinking
about throwing it out.


Ethan's up in a flash. 

ETHAN 
Man - really - I can have it? Cool. 
(picking it up) 
I could be a Ninja Darth Vader fighter 
with one of these - protect my mom from 
the evil super.


Virgil is up - with the spaghetti strainer in his hand. 

VIRGIL 
But first you'll have to fight 
off the evil --- whatever this is.


As they joust about - Virgil enjoying himself - there's a knock at 
the door. 

VIRGIL 
Could be the super - go for cover.


As Ethan ducks behind the couch, Virgil makes his way to the door, 
fumbling with the handle - he opens it to: 

JENNIE. Virgil stares at her. We soon realize he has no idea who 
this is. 

VIRGIL 
Yes?


Jenny looks at him, her eyes welling. 

JENNIE 
Virgil - it's me.


And suddenly Ethan is there - cane drawn like a sword. 

ETHAN 
En garde.


Jennie startled - looks to Ethan then Virgil. What's going on? 

VIRGIL
Jennie?! Jennie.. God, I'm sorry 
- c'mon in - this is my friend Ethan 
- what are you doing here?


Off Jennie's look: 

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

Virgil and Jennie standing across the street from a building being 
torn down. Hard hatted WORKERS hover about the large trucks at work. 

VIRGIL 
You want to tell me 
what we're doing here?


Jennie points. 

JENNIE 
That's him. That's our Father.


Virgil looks in the direction she's pointing - tries to focus on a 
figure moving across the lot. The MAN we saw watching TV. 

VIRGIL 
I can't - I can't see him.


Jennie looks to him. 

JENNIE 
I thought your eyes were better.


VIRGIL
No. I - I don't want to see him. 
My eyes aren't good enough - not yet 
- he won't understand. It won't be enough.


Virgil takes a step back. 

JENNIE 
He's our father. He heard about the 
operation and he's asked to see you. 
Look here he comes.


VIRGIL 
GODDAMIT Jennie - I don't want to 
see him - I don't even know why you
brought me here.


And Virgil takes another step back then turns and starts of f down 
the street leaving Jenny alone. 

INT. AMY'S BUILDING - NIGHT 

Amy making her way up the stairs - roll of plans under her arm. 
Opening her door to: 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

A totally dark room. She drops her things. 

AMY 
Virgil?... Virgil?!


She flicks on the light - to reveal Virgil has been sitting in the 
dark. She looks over - sees the scattered blocks on the floor. 

VIRGIL 
I'm here. I forget about the lights sometimes.


AMY
Look - about this party tonight 
- it's no big deal - maybe we should just...


VIRGIL
It's your partner's birthday. We should go 
- besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right?


AMY 
Yeah. Right.


INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

Noisy, crowded - PEOPLE mill about carrying drinks - black and 
silver balloons float about the ceiling. Moving through the crowd - 
music blasting - Amy introducing people to Virgil over the noise. 

A WAITER walks up to them holding a tray of wine. 

WAITER 
Glass of wine? Red - white?


Amy reaches out - takes one. 

VIRGIL 
Which is the red?


Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one. Virgil's hand reaches 
out slowly - hovering - it's clear it's confusing - trying to 
separate out one glass. The Waiter looks to Amy like ""is he OK?"" 

AMY 
Virgil - here let me.


Her hand darts in front of his. 

VIRGIL 
(quick) 
No! Sorry - I mean - I'm almost 
there - I think I got it.


And she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass - pulling it 
back. At the last second knocking over two other glasses. 

VIRGIL 
Dammit. Sorry.


The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself. 

WAITER 
Trust me - you're not the first - 
or probably the last. Let me get a cloth.


VIRGIL 
Thanks


The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off. Virgil nervously takes a 
large drink of wine. 

WAITER 
I hope you're driving.


Suddenly from the front of the room - MARSHALL, the host calls out: 

MARSHALL 
OK. He's coming up the stairs. 
Everybody get ready - kill the lights.


Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then CLICK - all the 
lights go out. Virgil panics momentarily. 

VIRGIL 
What - what's happening?


Amy moves to him in the near dark room. 

AMY 
It's for the surprise - 
they turned off the lights.


VIRGIL 
Surprise - yeah.


And suddenly the lights flood back on, everyone screams: SURPRISE!! 

Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely surprised - catches his 
breath - then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor. 

The room explodes in laughter - Amy included. This action is even 
more confusing to Virgil. 

VIRGIL 
Is he OK?


Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger laughter - Virgil now the 
focus of attention - good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles, 
embarrassed. Virgil takes a gulp of his wine, finishing it off. 

LATER: 

The Music is cranked! Many couples dance. Virgil exits the bathroom 
- glances back in the mirror again, at his hair - not sure he likes 
its style. He tries brushing it to the other side - it's OK. How 
about the other way - not so bad - maybe. It's clear he's a little 
tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair. 

WAITER (O.S.) 
Here ya go Virgil.


Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding a glass of wine - 
placing it carefully into Virgil's hand: 

VIRGIL 
Cheers, Kevin.


AMY (0.S.)
(over the noise)
Virgil!!


Virgil embarrassed, turns - can faintly hear Amy's voice over the 
music. Searches the room - bopping bodies - balloons being bashed 
round - lights dim. The number of drinks he's had isn't helping. 

AMY 
Virgil--over here!!


Amy, standing with Duncan and Betsy. 
DUNCAN
Maybe he's blind again.


AMY 
Don't even think it. C'mon - I want the 
both of you to meet him - he'll never 
find us here.


With VIRGIL - smiling as he sees Amy, Duncan and Betsy move towards 
him. 

AMY 
Virgil - I'm sorry - I went to get 
Duncan. Duncan - Virgil. And this is 
Betsy.


DUNCAN 
Hey Virgil good to meet you.


BETSY 
Heard a lot about you.


VIRGIL 
Heyyy! Yeah. Good to meet you.


Virgil thrusts his hand out - colliding it into Duncan's. 

VIRGIL 
Sorry - things still get a 
little cockeyed sometimes.


DUNCAN 
(holding up his drink) 
Few more of these and I'll be the same.


VIRGIL 
Lemme get Kevin - my man - 
he'll top you up. KE-VIN!!!


AMY 
Virgil!


VIRGIL 
What?


Uncomfortable - everyone stops. 

AMY 
Nothing. It's ok.


DUNCAN 
Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow...


AMY 
Duncan - I told you...


DUNCAN 
I spoke to Falk and he...


AMY 
(can't hear) 
What?


Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting Virgil and Betsy out. 

BETSY 
Amy said you had great hands. 


VIRGIL 
(laughs) 
She did, did she.


Virgil holds them up in front of his face - tries to see them. Then 
looks past them and watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly looks 
at Duncan's hair, his clothes. It's clear he's becoming aware of 
appearances. His own especially. 

As they break their tete a tete. 

BETSY
You know my father was blind for several 
years, he had cataracts as well.


Somehow this comes out patronizing. 

VIRGIL 
Really. I'm surprised I don't 
know him. It's a club you know.


Kevin, the African American waiter comes up. 

KEVIN 
Yes.


Virgil throws his arm around Kevin. 

VIRGIL 
Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man 
- could use himself a drink. Kevin here 
tells me he's black - did you know that
- I mean look at him - look at me -
isn't that the damnedest thing. He's black. 


Amy is mortified, Kevin laughs. 

KEVIN
I'll get you a drink.


Virgil looks to Amy. 

VIRGIL 
What's that look?


AMY 
What look?


VIRGIL 
I've never seen your face that way 
before. It's.. .weird. What does it mean?


Before she can answer - a dance song breaks out - Betsy wraps her 
arm around Duncan's. 

BETSY 
Come on Duncan - let's dance - 
move those old bones.


Duncan only acknowledges Betsy's contact with a raised eyebrow to 
Amy. 

DUNCAN 
What the hell it's my birthday -- nice to 
meet you Virgil - see you at the opening.


And they're gone onto the floor. Virgil watches him - sees the ease 
with which Duncan moves, handles things. 

VIRGIL 
Opening?


AMY 
The lobby we designed. Virgil - you can't...


VIRGIL 
Let's dance.


Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor. Amy - ready for 
one of Virgil's wild dances takes hold of his hand. The music 
blaring, Virgil starts to get into it - Amy starting to relax - then 
Virgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing - more 
conservative. 

He's even getting some looks from people. Slowly he winds down - 
tries to mimic what everyone else is doing - ends up in just a slow 
shuffle. 

Amy watches him - sees he's uncomfortable - moves to him - but 
Virgil turns on his heel and strides away. Amy follows after him. 

INT. LOFT - CORNER - NIGHT 

Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony. 
Amy comes up to him - finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut. 

AMY 
What are you doing?


Virgil's head cocks slightly towards her - just like when he was 
blind. 

VIRGIL 
I feel like Rip Van Winkle. 
I've woken up from a thirty year sleep 
- and the world's passed me by.


AMY 
It's just dancing. Who cares?


Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her shoulder to steady his look 
at her. 

VIRGIL 
No-no-no-no. It's not the Goddamn dancing. 
I wanted to come here tonight - show you I
could ""fit"" in. Like the big boys do. Big 
seeing boys. Yes. Well, I don't. Don't.


AMY 
It's just going to take time. 
You weren't ready. We shouldn't have come.


VIRGIL 
No - I - me, shouldn't have come. 
You want me to see - but you know what 
- you know what - shit - I don't belong 
in the wonderful world of seeing. 


Amy reaches out to him. 

AMY 
Virgil  look .


Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls his arm away. 

VIRGIL 
No, I won't. I'm tired of looking. 
Fuck looking and the horse it came in on.


And he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right 
into the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little 
crystals. 

The party slams to a halt - Amy stands stunned. Virgil shaken - tiny 
cuts on his face. 

AMY 
Oh my God, are you alright?


Virgil slams his eyes shut. 

VIRGIL 
Yeah, I'm just fine. Take me home.


INT. AMY'S LOFT - NEXT MORNING 

Virgil, small nicks on his face, wakes up - rolls over - feels the 
empty bed beside him. Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on - 
suitcase at her side. 

AMY 
Didn't want to wake you.


VIRGIL 
You're going.


AMY 
I'll only be a couple of days.


VIRGIL 
This isn't working.


AMY 
What - we're not working - your eyes 
- what's not working?


VIRGIL 
I get up every morning - I look in the mirror 
- and I stare at a total stranger. I stare and 
I stare - and no matter how hard I look - I 
don't see Virgil there anywhere. And the more 
I look at you...


AMY 
What? You don't see me?


VIRGIL 
I saw you better when I was blind.


AMY 
Well, you're not blind any more. 
I'm sorry if that disappoints you. 
(beat) 
I've got a plane to catch. I'm going 
to go before we say things we don't mean.


And she grabs her bag and is out the door. As we hold on Virgil's 
face. 

AT THE WINDOW - Virgil looking out - watching Amy get in the cab. 

As she drives away we see Virgil watch the car recede - then his 
hand goes out. 

HIS POV - his hand grasping at the tiny disappearing cab - trying to 
hold onto it like in Times Square - trying not to let it go. 

INT. FALK BOARD ROOM - DAY 

CLOSE ON - Amy's sketches. The Mall has been integrated into the two 
large trees - giving it shelter and shape. 

FALK (O.S.) 
I love it.


Amy and Duncan sit across from Falk, a man in his 40's - earned 
everything he's got - no bullshit kinda guy. 

FALK 
But we already cut those trees down.


EXT. NYU CAMPUS - DAY 

Kids milling about. A young couple neck unabashedly against a wall. 

We see this is Virgil's POV - he's watching - people together. 

INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY 

Virgil makes his way down the hall. Stops at an open doorway - a 
sign next to it with raised letters in Braille. As his hand feels 
across it - he also reads the visual letters - Dr. Ray Webster. 

Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the NEWLY BLIND - some 
TEENAGERS - a couple of ADULTS - a handful of SEEING IMPAIRED - all 
learning to use a cane. The rapid tapping of their cane like a room 
full of typewriters. 

Virgil watches - the Blind working their way around a small obstacle 
course - many of them running into desks, tables - it's tough, 
frustrating work. 

Suddenly Virgil feels someone next to him. Webster. 

WEBSTER 
You want to join us.


Virgil watches the blind. 

VIRGIL 
No - no - I'll wait for you 
out here - when you're done.


As Virgil moves off to a hallway bench: 

WEBSTER 
Virgil


Virgil turns as Webster tosses his something. Virgil misses it - it 
hits the ground - he reaches down - finding it, he picks it up - 
it's an apple. He looks to Webster who smiles back at him. 

WEBSTER 
I'll be done in a minute.


INT. HOTEL LOBBY - ATLANTA - DUSK 

Amy and Duncan walk through the lobby to their rooms. A little combo 
plays music in the adjacent bar - a few people on the tiny dance 
floor. 

AMY 
You'd think he would have told us. 
I mean those trees were in the photos.


DUNCAN 
We'll just have to win him over tomorrow. 
Let me buy you a drink - get those 
creative juices going.


AMY
(looks at her watch) 
Aw - no - I really...


But Duncan has her by the arm - and in one spin has her in a dance 
embrace. This move seems comfortable, familiar to them both. 

DUNCAN 
C'mon - listen, they're playing our song.


AMY 
(laughs) 
Mack the Knife was our song?


INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - LATER 

Webster is cleaning up after class. Virgil watching some of the 
Teenage kids and Adults find their way out of the room. As the last 
of them leaves. 

WEBSTER 
OK - I'm just about done here - I got a place
for you - relax those eyes a bit.


INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 

A table front and center. Some empty beer glasses in front of them. 
Two full ones in their hands - they're both a little in their cups. 
A STRIPPER grinds and weaves her way about the small dance floor to 
the sounds of Talking Heads ""Burning down the House"". 

VIRGIL 
(eyeing the girl) 
You want to know the truth -- God's honest truth? 
Seeing's been the shits.


WEBSTER 
You got to be kidding me son. You can say 
that - sitting here in these prime viewing seats. 
Forget fixing your eyes - we're going to get 
your head examined.


VIRGIL 
I'm serious. I was better off blind. 
People don't have these expectations of you 
you can't live up to. You're blind - 
fine - they deal with it.


WEBSTER 
Didn't get what you expected did you?


VIRGIL 
When I was blind - I had an image of 
what everything was, up here...
(points to his head)
now - it's all different - not at all 
what I'd expected - not what I'd hoped for.


WEBSTER 
Virgil, let me explain something here. 
When you were blind - you dealt with things 
one at a time - sequentially right? A wall 
led to a door to a tree to a car. That's 
how you got to what you wanted - right.
(beat)
Seeing people - for better or worse - 
deal with everything all at once - taking in 
the whole picture - which sometimes confuses 
the hell out of what they want.
(beat)
Virgil, my advice after three beers - don't be 
afraid to take in the whole picture - just don't 
lose sight of what you want.


VIRGIL
What I want is to make it work with Amy.


WEBSTER 
And what does she have to say


VIRGIL 
She just wants me to see.


WEBSTER 
It's that important is it?


VIRGIL 
You know what I learned a long 
time ago. Seeing girls like seeing guys. 
(beat) 
I'm not going to let her down.


INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 102 

Amy and Duncan are dancing - they seem good together. Nothing fancy 
- but they move as one about the floor. 

DUNCAN 
See - not so bad.


AMY
Not so bad.
DUNCAN 
It's nice to dance together again. 


AMY 
Yeah.


DUNCAN 
You remember...?


AMY 
First time we danced - Connecticut. We 
watched the leaves turn - so much to see 
- I'd love to go back. 


DUNCAN 
So would I. 
(beat) 
What happened to us Amy? You're so intent on 
fixing everything - why'd you give up on us?


AMY 
I learned some things can't be fixed. 
We got married for all the wrong reasons. 
I don't think I fell in love with you as 
much as I fell in love with architecture.


DUNCAN 
(serious) 
I never fell in love with architecture - 
but I know I fell in love with you. 


AMY 
Now - that's bullshit.


DUNCAN 
It used to work.


They smile at each other - everything's easy right now - pause - 
they dance - Amy looks up at Duncan - who hesitates - then leans in 
and kisses her. 

A moment and Amy pulls away slightly - looks down for a second - 
then she leans back in and they kiss again. We hold on this kiss, 
then cut to: 

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

BLACK - we hear movement - then a light comes on in the bathroom. 
Amy stands there clutching her clothes - staring into the mirror. In 
the background we see Duncan curled up asleep in bed. 

Amy stares at herself long and hard. 

AMY 
(whisper) 
Oh, God.


And she starts to dress: 

DUNCAN 
Amy? - what's going on -
what time is it?


Click - he flicks the bedside lamp on - squinting - finds Amy. She 
doesn't talk - keeps dressing. 

DUNCAN 
What's wrong?


AMY 
What's wrong? This was' a mistake - 
a big mistake. Go back to sleep - 
you've got an important meeting tomorrow.


DUNCAN 
I've got? - hold on here - you're not 
bailing out on me - I need you.


AMY 
(flat) 
For the meeting.


DUNCAN 
Of course for the meeting.


Dressed, she moves toward the doorway - Duncan sits up in bed. 

AMY 
I'm going home.


DUNCAN 
To be a babysitter.


She stops at the door. 

AMY 
Can't we for once be adults - face the 
fact that we've just made a colossal error? 


DUNCAN 
Fine - this was stupid, there - happy? - 
but goddamit Amy - I still care about you. 
Where do you actuallv think any of this is 
going to lead with this guy?


AMY 
I don't know - but the one good thing to come 
of this mess tonight - I know I want to find out.


And she's gone - WHAM. 

EXT. AMY'S LOFT - DUSK 

A cab pulls up - Amy gets out - looks up at her loft - it's dark. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - DUSK 

Kitchen light on - a pile of Ethan's blocks on the table. Amy makes 
her way over to see it reads: 

ON THE ROOF 

EXT. AMY'S ROOF - DUSK 

Amy opens the door and sees Virgil leaning against the parapet wall, 
staring out at the night Manhattan skyline. After a moment, he walks 
back to the other end of the roof, turns and slowly walk - toward 
the parapet wall again - all the time staring at the skyline - with 
a smile and look of amazement on his face. 

AMY 
Hi


Virgil turns - finds her. 

VIRGIL 
Hey.


Amy starts toward Virgil. 

AMY 
Whatcha doing?


VIRGIL 
It's the craziest thing. You start back over 
there - focus on a building. And when you walk 
towards it - it changes - each step makes it 
look different. I started out just looking 
for the horizon.


AMY 
You can't see it from here 
- too many buildings.


VIRGIL 
But it's still there - even though you can't 
see it - right? You gotta have faith it's there. 
Things exist beyond what I can see - 
I just have to take it on faith.


She comes up next to him - Virgil, looking out over the wall turns 
to her - studies her face: 

VIRGIL 
You have so many looks?


AMY There's something I have to tell you. 
I was getting confused - which is no 
excuse for how I've acted, but...


VIRGIL
Wait - no - this isn't your fault - 
I'm the one's been a shit. You're too 
hard on yourself - expect too much of yourself.


AMY 
Virgil 



VIRGIL 
(stopping her) 
Let me say this. Every day of my life - 
I've wished for just one thing.


AMY 
To see.


VIRGIL 
To be whole. For just one month. For just 
one day or one minute. For one goddamned 
half a second. And not just to be able to 
run, or ride a bike, or drive a car. 
(beat) 
But for once not to have a bruise from 
bumping into something or to stand in a room
and have to ask ""is anyone here"" and here 
that dead silence, knowing someone is there. 
Not to have food on my sweater, or have to 
put my finger in my glass to know when it's 
full. I just want to be whole. 
(beat) 
I went to see my father the other day.


Amy moves toward him. 

VIRGIL 
I couldn't face him. I felt like 
I was letting him down. I feel 
like I'm letting you down.


AMY 
No 



VIRGIL 
No, listen. I gave up years ago - I'm not 
going to give up now. Amy - that day I met 
you - for the first time in my life I felt 
someone needed me as much as I needed them. 
I don't want you to give up on me.


Amy out of breath - feels a surge of love for this man - moves in 
kissing him. A long kiss - then: 

VIRGIL 
Besides I couldn't leave you - 
I owe too much in back rent.


And as Amy pulls him into embrace - we hold on her face - then: 

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 

CLOSE ON - Dr. Aaron - harsh lights washing him out. 

AARON 
Up until the operation five weeks ago - 
Virgil had been a touch person - someone 
who's vocabulary, whole sensibility, 
his picture of the world was based on 
tactile -- non-visual terms.


INT. DOWNTOWN ATELETIC CLUB - DAY 

A HEALTH INSTRUCTOR - 50's Jack LaLaine type - is giving Virgil the 
tour of the facilities. They enter the weight/workout room. Various 
shapes and sizes of people work out on various shapes and sizes of 
workout machines. 

Aaron's voice-over continues as Jack motions to Virgil to follow 
him.. Virgil hesitates. 

HIS POV - chrome, iron, plastic - but somehow it's more defined than 
we've seen before. 

Determined - Virgil starts his way into the gym - hand' out brushing 
by what he sees in front of him. 

AARON (CONT) 
But - now - as a sighted person - by 
focusing singlemindedly on his goal, 
Virgil has a new found ability to 
understand his own physical relationship 
to objects in his life around him...


Virgil now drops his hand - starts moving through the maze of people 
and equipment - actually ""seeing"" his way. 

AARON (CONT.) 
Distance, size, shape - perspective - 
now all have profound meaning to him...


EXT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY 

Virgil negotiating a glass door - exiting the building. 

AARON (CONT) 

and though there are still miles to go in his 
learning process - for all medical intents 
and purposes - he is becoming a seeing person.


Virgil walking down the street - deftly dodging a kid on a 
skateboard - throwing out his hand to hail a cab. 
AARON (CONT.) 
This is an extraordinary achievement and 
advancement for medical science and a 
tribute to Virgil's determination to see.


INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 

AARON (CONT) 
Ladies and Gentlemen - Virgil Anderson.


Applause and Virgil looking to Amy in the audience, stands - a 
seeing man - and easily makes his way to the podium. Standing in the 
lights he readjusts the microphone - moving it up from the much 
shorter Aaron. 

VIRGIL 
(clears his throat) 
Since this may be one of our last 
sessions - are there any questions?


VOICE IN THE DARK 
Mr. Anderson - is there something you
were surprised to see for the first time
- something that looked quite different 
than you thought?


VIRGIL 
Breasts. 
(laughter) 
No, really. Don't get me wrong - I love them 
- they just weren't what I expected.


VOICE 
What about your girlfriend?


VIRGIL 
Whose did you think I was talking about?


Laughs. 

ANOTHER VOICE IN THE DARK 
Now that you're fully seeing - 
what are you looking forward to most?


VIRGIL 
Not having to do these sessions. 
(laugh) 
No - actually - being independent.


VOICE 
Can you read yet?


VIRGIL 
No, but...


VOICE 
Will you ever be able to?


VIRGIL 
I don't know.


VOICE 
If you can't read - will you ever be able to drive?


VIRGIL 
(suddenly somber) 
I don't know.


VOICE 
Well how can you say...


FAMILIAR VOICE 
(interrupting) 
Virgil. After so many years of darkness - 
describe what it is to actually see.


Angle on the Voice in the dark. Webster. 

CLOSE ON - Virgil - as he thinks about the question. 

INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT - AMY'S OFFICE - LATE DAY 

CLOSE ON - the Atlanta project. Miniature size. And a set of plans 
laid out across Amy's desk. Virgil's hand comes into frame - touches 
the model - moves to the plans - touches them. 

ON VIRGIL - alone in Amy's office - looking at her work. We go to 
his face - his eyes - we see that he is seeing Amy's work. 

AMY (O.S.) 
You're here.


Virgil looks up - Amy at the doorway. 

VIRGIL 
The Atlanta project - I thought it went away.


AMY 
Duncan did some song and dance - Falk's coming
to the lobby opening tomorrow - see our work.


VIRGIL 
I see it Amy.


AMY 
What's that?


VIRGIL 
Your world. What you do. The plans - 
the work the ideas. The molding. 
For the first time I really see what
you do - and not just up here... 
(he points to his head) but in here.


Virgil's hand goes out to her chest - places it on her heart. 

AMY 
(moves in close, sexy)
Tonight is your night something 
special I want to show you
VIRGIL 
What is it?


SMASH TO. 

EXT. BUILDING - LATE DAY 

AMY (V.0.) 
Everything.


TOP OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER 

The sun starting to set - the whole of the five burroughs of New 
York laid out in front of us. Virgil moves to the edge - looks out 
over this amazing panorama. 

Amy moves up next to Virgil - they take it in a moment. 

AMY 
That's the Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State 
Building, Chrysler building just over there...


VIRGIL 
Amy, look at me.


AMY 
What? 


VIRGIL 
This face - this is everything. It's all 
I've ever wanted to see. 
(he watches her) 
You have so many looks. 
What do all those looks mean?


AMY 
Well. Let's see. This... 
(makes corresponding face) 
... is sad. This...is frustrated. 
This... is tired. This.. is confused. 
This.. is happy. And this... 
(her face softens) 
... is what in love looks like.


Virgil puts his hand on her face - looks at it carefully. 

VIRGIL 
This look - this look I love. 

Amy leans forward and kisses him - and he soon forgets it even 
happened. As they kiss we pull slowly back and away as the sun goes 
deep gold and we start to hear what sounds like rain: 

We cut to: 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

And they are still kissing - and we realize they are in the shower - 
together - kissing - exploring - very sensual. As Virgil moves to 
kiss her neck - her breasts - Amy's head tilts back in to the spray. 

AMY 
Virgil - it's raining.


And he moves up again - looks her in the eyes - and for a moment his 
eyesight shudders ever so slight1y - it goes away and they kiss 
again. 

EXT. AMY'S LOFT - MORNING 

Amy and Virgil on the street - each hailing separate cabs. 

AMY 
So - eight o'clock tonight.


VIRGIL 
Eight o'clock - building opening - 
I haven't forgotten.


She blows him a kiss and she's gone. Virgil watches her cab pull 
away - clear something is bothering him. 

HIS POV - his vision going in and out. Then clear, then clouded 
again. 

INT. DOWNTOWN ATHLETIC CLUB - DAY 

Virgil's massage room. Not as organized as he had at Bear Mtn.. 
Virgil is working on an OVERWEIGHT MAN - his back is splotchy from 
too much sun. 

Virgil massaging - becomes preoccupied with his skin's imperfections 
- losing his concentration. 

OVERWEIGHT MAN 
Hey, Virgil - I'm the one supposed 
to fall asleep here. 


VIRGIL 
Yes - sorry.


He closes his eyes - gets back into his rhythm. 

INT. ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER 

Virgil, pack over his shoulder leaving for the day - about to cut 
through the weight room - when it suddenly comes to a halt. 

His POV - his vision fading in and out - and then suddenly quick 
flashes of black. On the final BLACK: 

We smash to: 

INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY 

Virgil at the desk. The Nurse looks up. 

VIRGIL 
Daphne - I need to see Dr. Aaron 
- right away. It's an emergency.


INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY 

Dr. Aaron is again examining Virgil on the Electroretinogram. Done, 
Aaron pulls the machine out of the way. Looks at Virgil - rubs his 
hand across his face. 

VIRGIL 
What does that mean?


AARON 
What?


VIRGIL 
What you just did?


Virgil imitates him. 

AARON 
It means - the machine is only registering 
sparks of activity - retinal sparks - 
followed by nothing. How long has this 
been going on?


VIRGIL 
I don't know - first I thought I was 
tired - some blurs - occasional cloudiness 
but it's been getting worse. Today I'm 
getting complete blackouts.


AARON 
Your retinal function is down ten 
percent. I'm afraid - your retinal 
disease seems to have returned.


VIRGIL 
You're afraid. What does that mean - I 
thought you corrected it. You told me 
I was a 'seeing person'.


AARON 
Now, you've every right to be upset. 
Maybe you didn't have the blood vessels 
to supply enough oxygen to the retinas. 
- Possibly some trauma - there are so 
many variables...(beat)
to be honest, I don't know. I wish to God I did.


Virgil stands, anxious - starts pacing. 

VIRGIL 
OK. You're the expert. Tell me - what 
do we do now - how do we repair this?


AARON 
Virgil. I -- I wish there was a 
nice way to say this.


Virgil backs away - doesn't want to hear it. 

VIRGIL 
No - there is no nice way to say it is 
there. No nice way to let the man know 
it's all over - that.. he's going blind again!


AARON 
Virgil, I understand what...


VIRGIL 
No you don't! Don't ever say that. 
You'll never understand. Ever!


Aaron stands there - says nothing - tries to let Virgil's anger 
dissipate. A long moment. 

VIRGIL 
How long?


AARON 
Hard to say. 
Month - few weeks - 
(beat) 
Days.


Virgil stands there stunned - then looking to Aaron. 

VIRGIL 
God, what do I tell Amy? 
What do I tell her?


On Virgil's face. 

INT. EYE INSTITUTE HALLWAY - DAY 

Virgil steps into the hall - Sees: 

A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY - blind - eyes half shut - hands reaching out, 
plodding it' a half circle over to where his mother waits for him. 

And we see the realization on Virgil's face of seeing his past - and 
what he will return to: 

EXT. STREETS - DAY 

Virgil RUNNING, RUNNING, best he can - through the crowded street - 
hands out - bumping into people - desperate - scared - trying to run 
from himself - from his fate. 

WHAM - he comes to a stop - out of breath - he looks left - right - 
where do you go - then sees something off screen. His face torn with 
fear - he moves forward - hand out - reaching to a window - to his 
own REFLECTION. 

And we push slowly in on the reflection as he touches the window - 
his hand on his face - a face he may never see again - and a cloud 
passes overhead and his reflection is gone. 

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

Virgil stands at the site - amidst the rubble and mud. His Father 
walks slowly over to him - raising his arms to embrace him. 

Virgil takes a step back - not, ready - his father stops, 
understands - looks his son up and down. 

FATHER 
You look good. Hey - how do I look?


VIRGIL 
I need some answers. Why'd you leave? Because 
I'm blind - or because I quit trying to see?


FATHER 
To the point - I like that - 
something you got from me.


VIRGIL 
Cut the bullshit - ""dad"". I don't hear from 
you for over twenty years - then you find 
out I can see and all of a sudden you show up?


FATHER 
(looks around) 
Hey. Virge - can we talk about this later, huh...


VIRGIL 
No, not later. Now! Was my blindness so 
wrong that made you tear our family apart.


Virgil's riled his father. He steps towards Virgil tries to speak 
under his breath. 

FATHER 
Every morning I woke up and looked at you 
and saw my own failures. If I couldn't get 
my own son to see then...What difference 
does any of this make - you can see now 
- hell, I knew you could.


Virgil watches his father - this stranger. His eyes start to well. 

VIRGIL 
I'm going blind again.


His Father looks at him - stunned. He reels from the news - takes a 
step back. 

FATHER 
No...


VIRGIL 
The doctor told me today. You're the first 
person I've told. I wanted to come see 
you before it was completely gone.


FATHER 
(speechless) 

A beat and Virgil's father takes another step back, then turns and 
walks away - forever. 

EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY 

Virgil standing across the street. Trying to take in the building 

EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY 

Standing at the front as a security guard opens the door. 

GUARD 
Sorry the building doesn't open until tonight.


VIRGIL 
I know. I'm Virgil Anderson...with Roswell 
Tremont. We did the lobby. I'm here to 
check some details for tonight.


GUARD 
Oh, okay, sure Mr. Anderson.


INT. LOBBY - LATE DAY 

The lobby is pretty, straightforward. Open - a few plants - a large 
central check in desk. Simple - unobtrusive - nothing exceptional or 
unique. 

Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking at it carefully from 
every possible angle - his hand grazing across walls, entranceways - 
desperately committing as much as he can to memory - finally ending 
up in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as 
he can. 

GUARD (O.S.) 
You want to see that the thing work?


VIRGIL 
Thing? What thing?


GUARD 
This thing


The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and against one section of 
windows a wall of water comes dripping down - causing a shower of 
indoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off of the walls. 

Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his eyes - listening to 
the indoor rain - really taking in the room having total empathy 
with what Amy has created. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - BATHROOM 

Virgil, wrapped in a towel, is shaving. But he has his eyes closed. 
Amy comes in, dressed beautifully - using the mirror to put her 
earrings in. Virgil quickly opens his eyes. 

VIRGIL 
You nervous?


AMY 
No - not a bit. 
What do you think?


She pivots for him. 

VIRGIL 
You look great.


AMY 
Really. Not too flashy? 
(she looks in the mirror, she is nervous) 
I'm going to change.


Virgil lets her go - calls to her. 

VIRGIL 
This is an important night for you.


AMY 
But you know what's most important... 
(she pokes her head in) 
That you're going to be there to see it.


Virgil turns to the mirror, stares at himself - contemplating what 
he's up against. 

INT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT 

The lobby is filled with business types, waiters circulating with 
champagne, tiny hors-d'oeuvres. Virgil and Amy enter - standing at 
the top of the stairs leading to the party. Virgil immediately going 
into a performance for Amy. 

AMY 
So.


VIRGIL 
Amy, it's good - very good. 
I'm proud of you. I love the detail 
- planted pots in the corners, 
the moldings... 
(beat) 
It's got genuine lines.


AMY 
(excited) 
Look around - do you see it?


VIRGIL 
What?


He looks about the room - then turns towards the indoor rain. 

HIS POV - clear - then slight haziness - a momentary flash of black 
- then back in focus. 

He turns to Amy. Puts his arm around her. 

VIRGIL 
Our rain. 


AMY 
Your rain.


DUNCAN 
Hey Virgil.


He extends his hand. Virgil, obliged slowly extends his - having 
trouble focusing - but Duncan helps him - taking hold of it and 
shaking it. 

DUNCAN 
Still working on that hand shake 
you'll get it don't worry.


VIRGIL 
Congratulations - the place looks great.


DUNCAN 
Thanks - here's the genius though - 
I just get the gigs. Can I steal her 
away Falks' over there and I can't 
tell if he's impressed with our work 
or just has gas from the pate.


VIRGIL 
Go - do your thing.


AMY 
I'll be right back. There's food 
and drinks down on the floor.


Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil tries to find a safe 
place to stand. His eyesight fading in and out - he looks around - 
decides to negotiate the steps: 

He takes one step on the stairs - looks down - is able to see Amy 
with Falk and Duncan, looking up at him - she smiles - he does his 
best - smiles back - lets go of the handrail - takes another step - 
finally reaching the bottom floor. 

He stands there for a long moment - lost as to where to move. A 
glimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using 
the sound to help guide him. 

Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the floor - gives him a 
little wave - he doesn't notice her. 

At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound. A FIGURE comes up 
next to him. 

VIRGIL 
Quite a party. Love the detail of the building.


WEBSTER 
Sometimes the detail doesn't matter.


Virgil stops - turns to Webster. 

VIRGIL 
Ray. What are you doing here?


WEBSTER 
Aaron called me. He was worried. 
I've been trying to find you - 
Amy's office told me you were 
here. It's bad?


VIRGIL 
It's almost gone. Last few days 
have been pretty bad.


WEBSTER 
Obviously Amy doesn't know.


VIRGIL 
It's going to break her heart. 
This is her big night - I didn't 
want to ruin it. Thought I could 
pull it off.


WEBSTER 
(beat) 
You can't avoid this forever.


Virgil turns back towards the rain. 

VIRGIL 
I know 
(beat) 
So Ray? Is it better to have seen and 
lost than never to have seen at all?


WEBSTER 
I thought it was loved and lost.


Amy comes up to them. 

AMY 
Dr. Webster - this is a surprise.


WEBSTER 
Virgil invited me - wanted to show 
you off I think. The place is terrific 
- he's got every right to be proud.


AMY 
Thank-you. I need Virgil for a 
moment - schmoozing time.


WEBSTER 
Shmooze away.


VIRGIL 
(as he's led away) 
Thanks Ray. I'll call you.


ANGLE ON - Duncan standing anxiously with Falk and his wife Donna as 
they arrive. 

AMY 
Virgil - I'd like you to meet Jack 
Falk and his wife Donna up from Atlanta.


VIRGIL 
Pleased to meet you.


DONNA 
Amy tells us you were blind.


Amy spurts out a glass of wine. Virgil deflects the comment. 

VIRGIL 
That's OK - nice to see someone so honest.


FALK 
Amy tells us you're her inspiration. 
Any help you can give us with our project?


VIRGIL 
I'm a little biased but I kind of 
liked Amy's original design.


FALK 
But could we do better.


Amy jumps in with. 

AMY 
We could do better, Mr. Falk - a lot better.


FALK 
Good, I like that attitude. 
Let's keep trying for perfection.


Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around Virgil. 

AMY 
That's right - that's 
why I've got Virgil.


Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and the others continue - 
we push in on Virgil as he takes in this thought. 

EXT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT 

Virgil and Amy out front. People leaving - Duncan getting into a 
town car with Falk and his wife - he looks back - gives the thumbs 
up and climbs in after them. The car pulls away into the night. 

VIRGIL 
You wanna walk - I feel like some air.


AMY 
See what we see? Sure.


VIRGIL 
Can I take your arm - eyes a little tired.


As they walk. 

VIRGIL 
You really made the place 
come alive with that fountain.


AMY 
Thank-you. 
(beat) 
You know I've been thinking - you're doing 
so great now - and if we get this new 
design job we'd have some extra money
- I think we should go on a big seeing
celebration.


VIRGIL 
(taken aback) 
A seeing celebration?


AMY 
Yeah, maybe in a couple of months. 
I looked into Egypt - we could see 
the pyramids - we could see it 
together for the first time. 
What do you say?


VIRGIL 
You know - there is something 
I'd like to see.


AMY 
Of course, anything.


VIRGIL 
The Rangers play tomorrow. Season'll 
be over before we know it - could be
our last chance.


AMY 
The Rangers. Sure, why not?


BLACK 

Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that grows increasingly 
larger as we move towards a SOUND. A hum that grows in intensity 
until the light fills the frame and BAM - we exit the tunnel and we 
are: 

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT 

That glorious first view - people - the white ice shining below like 
a giant jewel- and the players - in bright colors scurrying about 
the playing surface below. 

AMY 
This is amazing - isn't it?


She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is seeing. Then suddenly 
on his face - a flash - one of those moments of darkness. 

AMY 
Should we find our seats. Looks 
like the game's already started.


VIRGIL 
Yeah - I - I'll follow you.


INT. GARDEN - SEATS - LATER 

Virgil and Amy in the loge seats - on the aisle - up behind the 
goal. Amy looking at the stadium while Virgil next to her, watches 
the game best he can. 

AMY 
I love the stadium the 
way it's structure...


VIRGIL 
Amy - the game...


AMY 
Right - the game.


SMASH - a hard check into the boards deep in the Rangers end of the 
ice. The puck squirts out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice 
- one, two it's back to him and he has a wide open break from center 
ice - the crowd is out of their seats - Virgil included - Amy 
quickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm. 

On Virgil's face - watching Gretzky skate towards him - excited - 
then losing him - another flash of blackness - like a blow to the 
head - and we hear the crowd suddenly explode - and as Virgil's 
vision regains we see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal - the 
little red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening. 

We see the frustration as Virgil realizes he'll never see it. 

AMY 
He scored, he scored - you see 
that - it was amazing.


As the players make their way to center ice - the crowd sits and Amy 
sees the expression again on his face. 

AMY 
What? That was good right?


VIRGIL 
Yeah - it was great - I was just...


Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed. Walking down the aisle, away 
from him: 

A VENDOR - carrying a tray of PINK COTTON CANDY. 

Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed - then like in a trance - 
he stands - stepping out into the aisle - a man on a mission. 

AMY 
Virgil, where are you going?


And he's on the stairs - carefully moving down the stairs toward the 
vendor. 

Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a large cotton candy - 
round and puffy like a cloud - but something he can hold in his 
hand. Amy can't believe it - watching Virgil - his fascination at 
finding this long lost memory. 

AMY 
The puffy thing.


Angle on Virgil turning - admiring his prize - then looking up, 
trying to find Amy - who waves to him excited. 

HIS POV - scanning the crowd - it's hazy - then flashes of dark. 

Amy's face - suddenly drops - it's clear, even though she is only 
four rows up - he doesn't see her. 

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT 

Game is over - Virgil is packing up his stuff - Amy staring. at him. 

AMY 
Virgil, what's happening?


VIRGIL 
Just having a bad eye day. 
A lot to take in.


AMY 
Tell me. What's going on?


VIRGIL 
Nothing. I see almost nothing.


Amy: she feels like she's about to explode. 

AMY 
Oh God.


VIRGIL 
It's OK.


AMY 
OK?!!


VIRGIL 
It's OK for you to cry.


AMY 
(recovering) 
No, no - I'm not going to cry. 
Solve the problem. We made it 
through one operation - we'll 
make it through another. We won't
give up. We'll get this right 
- we just need to...


VIRGIL 
I saw Dr. Aaron. 
There's nothing they can do.


AMY 
Then we'll find another Doctor. 
There's got to be someone else. 
We'll find something that works.


VIRGIL 
Don't you get it - 
I can't go through this again.


AMY 
So just like that - we just forget it - 
give up? Why the hell haven't you told
me what was going on?


VIRGIL 
(whirls on her) 
Because of this!!


AMY 
What this?


VIRGIL 
You! Not letting it go - thinking 
there's a solution. Goddamit, 
I'm not design flaw in your fucking 
work that you can just change to 
make work Or throw away because 
it doesn't meet your expectations. 
(beat) 
Let's face it - it's over!!


AMY 
Virgil, give it time, you'll see.


VIRGIL 
No! I won't! This conversation is ended!!


INT. AMY'S APARTNENT - NIGHT 

The door swings open - Amy and Virgil enter - Virgil moves towards 
the bed - pulls out his duffel bag. 

AMY 
What are you doing?


VIRGIL 
I'm leaving.


AMY 
What do you mean leaving - you're 
leaving this apartment - you're 
leaving New York - you're leaving me?


Virgil turns - they stand across the room from each other - miles 
apart. 

VIRGIL 
I'm going home.


Amy walks toward him, picking a battle, rejection. 

AMY 
So you're big sister can take care of you - 
feed you TV dinners for of your life.


Virgil tries to side step her. 

VIRGIL 
I'm not going to go through this bullshit again.


Amy moves in front - confronting him 

AMY 
Is that what this has all
been to you - bullshit?


VIRGIL 
Yes!! Who the hell were we fooling? 
I'm blind - I'm not meant to see 
- I don't belong here.


AMY 
God damn right you're blind. You want to 
live in your own little world - this perfect 
world that your sister built for you 
- where no one can touch you ... where no 
one can reach you.


VIRGIL 
Do you know the reason why I remembered the 
cotton candy all those years? Because I went 
to the game with my father. And it's the 
only good thing I can remember about him. 
The rest is him pushing me to be something
I'm not - then turning his back on me the 
minute his plans fail.


AMY 
I am not turning my back on you. 
You want me to give up on you 
- you love the self pity.


VIRGIL 
I don't want you to give up on ME. 
But you won't give up on me seeing.


AMY 
Because there must be other options.


VIRGIL 
Not anymore.


Virgil, avoiding her, sidesteps quickly past her - straight into the 
lamp, which crashes to the ground and breaks. 

DARKNESS. 

VIRGIL 
Dammit.


A short few steps then a much larger crash - the sound of a large 
heavier thing breaking. 

AMY 
Virgil!!


Amy feels her way to the lights - and turns them on. We see that 
Virgil has collided with Amy's sculpture of the woman. He sits among 
the pieces on the floor. 

Virgil - feeling the damage. 

AMY 
(going to him) 
Is anything broken?


VIRGIL 
No - no bones are broken.


Virgil uses the wall to stand - then - with his hands out in front 
of him he finds his way to the bed. 

VIRGIL 
It's finished - can't you see that! 
We both didn't get what we wanted.


AMY 
(quietly) 
I never meant to hurt you.


VIRGIL 
When you asked me to come here - 
did you ever think this wasn't going 
to work - that for one minute I may 
not be able to see. 
(beat) 
Did you ever think it would be OK 
to have a relationship with a blind man?


Amy - a pause.. Too long. 

VIRGIL 
There's my answer.


And he grabs his duffel and pack - throws the last few things in - 
and moving to the door - leaves. 

INT. BUS - NIGHT - RAINING 

Virgil riding - crossing the George Washington Bridge - going home. 
He looks out the window - sees the receding city - and he closes his 
eyes - listens to the rain. 

EXT. PINECREST - MAIN STREET - NIGHT 

The Bus comes down the main street of Pinecrest. Stopping - the bus 
door opens and Virgil gets out - and turns to face up the street - 
the street he knew so well that is so foreign to him right now. 

EXT. VIRGIL AND JENNIE'S - NIGHT 

The door opens. Jennie smiles warmly, reaches out to him. 

JENNIE 
Welcome home.


INT. HOME - NIGHT 

Virgil and Jennie entering his place - to be greeted immediately by: 

SOPHIE bounding across the floor towards them - tail wagging - 
tongue hanging out. 

VIRGIL 
Sophie!?


And he bends down to hug her. Sophie laps at his face. Virgil holds 
her back to get a good look at her. 

VIRGIL 
Let me look at you. 
You're so beautiful.. yes.


Jennie watches her brother - happy to have him home. Hoping to get 
him back to 'normal'. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - LATER 

Virgil walks around, touching things, seeing the simplicity of his 
life. Nothing on the walls - no decorations - no plants. Everything 
functional. He realizes this is a home designed by his sister. 

He moves over to the photo of the family. He on his dad's shoulders. 
Stares at it - at his father and mother for the first time. 

JENNIE 
Mom and dad. 

Virgil just stares. 

JENNIE 
Everything's as you left it. 
Nothing's changed.


VIRGIL 
Jen - I'm pretty tired - 
I'd like to be alone.


The PHONE rings. Rings again. Virgil doesn't move - his apprehension 
is clear - he knows who it is. Jennie sees this and moves toward the 
phone. 

Virgil turns and walks out onto the front porch - followed by 
Sophie, as his sister picks up the phone in the background. 

EXT. VIRGIL'S PORCH - NIGHT 

He sits down - looks into the night as we hear Jennie faintly on the 
phone. A beat and she hangs up. We hold on Virgil: 

EXT. PINECREST STREET - DAY 

Virgil walks down Main street. Seeing his town - a town he grew up 
in but now seems so foreign. Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he 
sees. 

The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl at the helm. Somehow 
it's not what he expected. 

INT. ROSWELL-TRRMONT DESIGN FIRM - DAY 

Amy organizing all her work on the Atlanta project - - the original 
designs - the new design with the trees - then she sees: 

The sketch she made of the ""dancing trees"". Her eyes hold - and she 
slowly shuts them - and with them tightly closed - her hand reaches 
out and runs along the drawings. 

EXT. PINECREST - END OF MAIN STREET - DAY 

We find Virgil standing - looking out at the end of the street where 
he stood with Amy. In front of him he sees: 

The ""dancing trees"". 

VIRGIL'S POV - a retinal spark - a quick glimpse of the intertwined 
trees - one lover choosing between two others. 

INT. FIREHOUSE - LATE DAY 

Virgil - stands in the middle of the room. Looks about at what was 
at one time so special to him. Now it just seems old and dingy - the 
magic is gone. 

He closes his eyes for a moment - listens - cocks his head to the 
left - the right - but there is nothing there. 

EXT. TOWN LIBRARY - LATE DAY 

Virgil standing outside - staring at a building he's never seen - 
never been inside. 

HIS POV: flickering a moment. 

INT. LIBRARY - SUNSET 

Virgil now sits at a table. Stacks and stacks of LIFE magazine 
splayed out in front of him. He is flipping through them at a rapid 
rate - like a drowning man searching for air. 

IMAGES - cars, JFK, the pyramids, Martin Luther King, houses, 
flowers, Marilyn Monroe, that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam, 
African masks, Dachau prisoners, Nixon, Warhol paintings, the Mona 
Lisa, that vulture watching over the little baby, the Eiffel tower, 
First Man on the moon, the Venus De Milo, that guy in front of the 
tank in Tianaman square .. and the Pyramids. 

The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil soaking them up like a 
sponge - life, beauty, horror, great people, great events... 

And we move in on his face - absorbing these images for the last 
time - a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing. And we 
cut to: 

EXT. AMY'S ROOF - SUNSET 

Golden rays of the late afternoon sun. Amy on the roof - leaning on 
the parapet - watching the horizon. 

Then a thought comes to her. And mimicking what Virgil had done - 
she walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and looks out 
towards the skyline again ... then starts slowly walking towards the 
parapet till she reaches the wall again. 

The reaction on her face - she doesn't ""see"" it - not like Virgil 
did. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - DAY 

Virgil is shifting furniture in his house. A table - moves it to the 
window - moves a chair to join it - stands back to have a look at 
it. 

HIS POV - a moment of clear - then haze - then dark - then haze. 

Virgil rubs his head - these last days of sight have been painful 
and exhausting for him. 

JENNIE (O.S.) 
Hello! 

She's at the door. Virgil cocks his head in her direction. 

JENNIE 
I picked up some things at the store - 
T-shirts, I'm sure you're out, some socks...


VIRGIL 
Jennie, what's at the 
end of Main Street?


JENNIE 
Well - I think it's Vivian's little stationery...


VIRGIL 
Beyond all the stores - past firehouse. 
What happens when this is no more Main Street?


JENNIE 
Well - there's nothing really - you know that. ~ 

VIRGIL 
No! You told me that's all there was. 
That's wrong. There's a helluva lot out there.


Jennie surprised at where this is going. 

JENNIE 
I told you what you needed to know.


VIRGIL 
What was within my reach.


JENNIE 
What more do vou want?


VIRGIL 
Isn't there anything more that vou want?


JENNIE 
Is this about our father -
he called told me...


VIRGIL 
No. This isn't about him. Jennie - 
you've spent your whole life as 
blind as I was. The world doesn't 
stop within our reach.


JENNIE 
Virgil, please. This is your home. 
Stop thinking about what's out there 
- things that will never matter to you. 
You're safe here where everyone...


VIRGIL 
Where everyone what!?


JENNIE 
Knows you.


VIRGIL 
Can protect me?! (beat) 
Jennie, this place was a wonderful safe 
haven for me growing up. I know that. 
(looking around) 
And I can only imagine what you gave up 
to keep this world for me. I thank you 
and love you from the bottom of my soul. 
But now I want to give you your life back.


JENNIE 
Virgil, I - I can't...


VIRGIL 
You can


Virgil reaches out his arms for her to join him. 

VIRGIL 
I'm reaching out, Jennie.


This gets Jennie and she goes to him, really hugging him for the 
first time as tears flow from her eyes. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY 

Amy, dressed in sweat pants and tee shirt sitting on the ground, 
trying to piece the sculpture back together. It's a difficult fix. 

KNOCK KNOCK 

DUNCAN 
Amy - you in there.


AMY 
Go away.


She scrapes some plaster into a dust pan. We hear enters a key in 
the door - and the door opens. Duncan 

DUNCAN 
I knew keeping this key would come in 
handy one day. What a mess - what happened?


AMY 
It broke - I'm trying to fix it.


DUNCAN 
So - guess what?


AMY 
I'm not in the mood for games.


DUNCAN 
We got it. The goddamned Atlanta mall - 
we got it!! Now - pull yourself out of this 
slump - I want you to fly down this week to...


Continuing to work on the sculpture. 

AMY 
I'm not going.


DUNCAN 
What are you ta1king about? 
What's the problem here?


AMY 
The problem?! Everything. 
Nothing is right thank-you very much.


DUNCAN 
You know what the problem is - you're 
the problem - you met a blind guy you 
thought was cool and spent the first 
two months trying to change him.


AMY 
Are you finished?


DUNCAN 
Not even close. Let me tell you something 
- you can't change people to solve you. 
You tried to do it with me - you tried 
to do it with Virgil. You ever think 
some of the things you try to fix 
- ain't broke.


And he's gone - as Amy slumps into a chair - confused, tired - then 
slowly she starts to hear: 

TAP - TAP - TAP...TAPTAP - TAP 

The SOUND of a CANE in the stairwell! Amy's heart starts racing - 
she takes a breath - jumps up quickly and moves her way over to the 
door - unlocking it and swinging it open: 

AMY 
(excitedly) 
Virg .......


The CANE - being held by Ethan - as he taps his way down the stairs. 

ETHAN 
Hey Amy.


AMY 
Hi, Ethan. Sorry - I thought...


ETHAN 
He's not coming back is he?


AMY 
No - he's not.


Ethan sees she's covered in dust - looks past her into the loft. 

ETHAN 
Whatcha doin'?


He looks past her at the sculpture half repaired. 

AMY 
Cleaning up a mess - going to start over.


EXT. PINECREST - SUNSET 

Virgil walks the path, Sophie following close behind. By the way he 
walks, counting steps, touching landmarks, we realize he is using 
sight very little. 

EXT. HIDDEN VALLEY - SUNSET 

Coming through the clearing, to the plateau where he took Amy, the 
leaves now starting to turn golden colors - he stops - stands over 
top of the pond. 

VIRGIL'S POV - A retinal spark. The view across the valley, with 
white clouds against the bluest sky. 

His hand reaches out - to touch the edge of the world - to touch the 
horizon. 

And as he drops his hand, we see the clouds start to race by - while 
the blue sky goes golden then drifts into darkness. Virgil doesn't 
move from the spot. The screen goes almost black - then slowly the 
sun starts to rise in the east. 

Virgil makes no movement. A long beat - then - as the sun moves 
across him - he realizes it's day. He stands and unfolds his cane. 
It's clear he has returned to being completely blind. 

As he turns and starts his way down the hill we hear: 

VIRGIL (V.O.) 
Growing up blind - I had two dreams. 
One was to see. The other - to play 
for the New York Rangers.


INT. LECTURE HALL - N.Y. EYE INSTITUTE - DAY 

Virgil stands at the podium speaking - dark glasses on, cane in 
hand. 

VIRGIL 
After the 'miracle' of my short period of 
sight - I realize - I'd rather play for the Rangers. 
(laughs from the dark) 
It's not that it was so awful - I saw many 
things - some good, some back some that 
I'm already forgetting.


INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - NYU 

VIRGIL (V.O.) 
But I realized that our eyes aren't what 
make us see. We only live in darkness 
when we don't look - look at what is 
genuine about ourselves - genuine 
about others - you don't need eyes for that.


Virgil sitting with three young blind children - working through 
Braille with them. Webster watches from the corner of the room. 

EXT. NYU - DAY 

Virgil - small brown bag in one hand - cane in the other - exits the 
building and makes his way across the street to Washington Square. 

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY 

Virgil - taking in the sun - finishing off the last of his sandwich. 
Balling up his paper bag - he taps his cane out - finds the garbage 
can nearby - and tosses the bag - rim shot - it misses, hits the 
ground. A hand reaches into frame and puts the bag in the garbage. 
Virgil looks up - senses the presence. 

VIRGIL 
Did I miss?


VOICE (O.S) 
By a mile.


VIRGIL 
Amy?


ANGLE ON Amy: watching Virgil - realizing his sight is gone. 

AMY 
Ray told me you were living in town 
- said I could find you here. 
(beat) 
I rushed, didn't I? Fourteen steps 
to the tree and I made us smash 
right into it.


VIRGIL 
We tried.


Amy sits next to him. 

AMY 
I finished the sculpture. 
I'd love you to see it.


VIRGIL 
Figure of speech.


AMY 
Figure of speech. Virgil - when I 
first met you - you saw more than 
any sighted person I've ever known. 
I didn't mean to take that away from you.


VIRGIL 
Amy. I saw ... I actually saw 
the horizon. You did that for me. 
It's out there. You showed me you 
just have to reach for it..


Amy smiles - her hand goes out - hesitates - then lands lightly on 
his. 

AMY 
You want to walk?


VIRGIL 
See what we see?


AMY 
Yeah. Just see what we see.


Virgil smiles, nods. As he stands - he takes her arm - and as they 
walk off into the park, we slowly FADE to BLACK and just LISTEN, 
listen to the SOUNDS of the day - the percussion of the city.

					THE AVENGERS

				Screenplay by Don Macpherson

					June 21, 1995

1BLUE SKY WITH CLOUDS

PAN DOWN to reveal:

2EXT - SALTFLATS - DAY

A flat horizon, stretching to infinity.

A 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No 
animals, no humans, no objects.  Except in mid distance --

3RED PHONE BOX

brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  
Perfectly
ordinary -- except for its location.

Silence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except --

The PHONE RINGS.

RING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to 
answer it.  But of course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except --

4IN DISTANCE

a CAR ENGINE ... A puff of smoke on the horizon ... VA-VA-VOOM of high 
geared acceleration, as INTO VIEW

ZOOM! --

5CAR

speeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  
A petite open-top '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full 
throttle, it nears the phone box, and --

SCREECHES to a halt.

Dust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops --

6KINKY BOOT

in black leather.

Buckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground.
PAN UP TO:

7BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

late 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of 
auburn hair.  Black leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, 
thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps at ankles, zips --

Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, 
invulnerable, cool.  Very cool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  
Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up the phone.

					EMMA
			How now brown cow ...
				(pause)
			The rain in Spain falls mainly
			on the plain ...
				(pause)
			The quick brown fox jumped over
			the lazy --

From the receiver, an irritated official voice.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Password affirmative. Thank you,
			Doctor.

Emma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  
Then presses button bakelite box.

A second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as --

8INSIDE PHONE BOX

the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the 
box, a notice now reads ""Out of Order.""

Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the 
desert:  ""London 84 miles.""

9INT.  LABORATORY

underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research 
lab in retro hi-tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange 
steel corridors, Werner von Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  
""Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel Only."" Logo with lightning 
emerging from a cloud.

10FROM AIRLOCK DOOR

A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  
Early 40's, handsome, charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  
His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

					PETER
			Ready, darling?

Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her 
breast.  She smiles.

					EMMA
			Ready as I'll ever be ...

Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they 
walk down:

11LONG CORRIDOR

air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth -
-

A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of 
Peter.  On his name tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

					VALENTINE
			Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
			Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
			set ... Temperature control on course between 
			one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

					PETER
			Anything else?

Valentine smiles, shrugs --

					VALENTINE
			Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

					EMMA
			Thanks, Valentine ...

Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

A shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

					PETER
			Just a minute, darling. My brother's a 
			worry wart. I better have a word ...
			Valentine --

Peter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  
Behind her a conversation.  Peter returns.

He takes a ring from his finger --

12CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM

on a gold ring.

13BACK TO SCENE

He slips it onto her finger.

					PETER
			Something to remember me by.

Peter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to 
query.  She smiles back.  He gives her a kiss --

					PETER
				(checks his watch)
			See you in an hour ...

					EMMA
			One sunny day ...

The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.

14IN DISTANCE

Valentine watches her.

15INT.  LAB CHAMBER

Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel 
radioactive thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

The effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping 
Beauty, beauty entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down 
into a vault.  Opposite her --

In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.

16FROM EMMA'S POV

The sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF 
ELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  
Technological, erotic. Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at 
him, as --

17UP IN CONTROL ROOM

Valentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  
He attends to dials.  And to his female assistant --

					VALENTINE
				(thrilled)
			Readings still normal ...

The assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

An insignia tattooed on her neck: ""X404.""  A replicant.
They monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.

18EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

A weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver 
blob, like a Koons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...

19DOWN BELOW

A temperature gauge rises.

The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- 
red.  Starts to heat up as if --

It soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.

20CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL

""CUMULUS COLLECTOR."" The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a 
MURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

The gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

Suddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.

21DOWN IN HIS VAULT

Peter Peel's ""coffin"" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

					PETER
				(intercom cutting out)
			Losing control -- malfunction
			in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
			-- Emm --!

22IN CONTROL ROOM

Needles push off the dials, as --

The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in 
clusters of molten metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's 
eyes widen in alarm ...

					COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
			Five -- four --  three -- two --
			one ... Three -- two -- one ...
				(repeating)
			Three -- two -- one ...

23INSIDE COFFIN

Peter's glass cracks

The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants 
running ...

24IN HER COFFIN

Emma realizes; looks to Peter --

25EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

The ""Koons"" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from 
otherwise blue sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into

26INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic 
stations! Valentine looks aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, 
over the intercom --

					VALENTINE
			Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

					VALENTINE
			Emma ...

27FROM HER VAULT

Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod

28ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)

Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally 
replayed for her as a nightmare --

29BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!

30RAPID INTERCUTS

The purple smoke enveloping Peter'spod, soft caresses -- Peter 
struggling within, looking at Emma --

					EMMA
			Peter!

Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT 
sounds ... She grabs, claws on glass --

Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES 
the pod cover, it --

Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a 
spider's web, as behind her

					VALENTINE
			Don't wait for him -- he's not --

Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn 
leather glove -- twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound 
growing as:

31ABOVE GROUND

The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!

32CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --

33BACK TO SCENE

					PETER
				(faint)
			Emma ... Emma ...

As a GROWLING sound grows till

BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and 
vision separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her 
psyche.  A trauma.

34ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)

The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a 
dream, floating backwards in --

A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of 
control, weightless, powerless, as --

The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, 
black void opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new 
version of the ""AVENGERS"" THEME TUNE --

CREDITS SEQUENCE.

35SERIES OF SHOTS

In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space

An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic 
followed by blasts of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic 
patterns over --

A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's 
leather-clad 
body --

In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  
Flashes of:  hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding 
and unfolding, then tightly shut.

A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing 
into black and white of a chessboard as ...

A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, 
boots ... hair tossed back -- red nails over black ... creamy white 
skin ... zips ...

A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian 
knotted tie -- umbrella stabs like a sword --

Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, 
gash -- rose cut and tossed into --

His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
Then --

PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:

36INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled 
by the shots, naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she 
looks around her Klaus
Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead 
husband, Peter Peel. From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --

37HER POV

a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early 
morning streets.  The damn thing BACKFIRES again ...

38BACK TO SCENE

Emma frowns, annoyed.

39EXT.  STREETS - DAWN

Zoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted 
streets.  Inside is a bowler-hatted man --

JOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's 
clothes.  A Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, 
embroidered waistcoat.
A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- 
hard-edged, steely menace.  He drives through --

40LONDON (1999)

This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, 
forever England. Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in 
final decadent bloom.  White stucco buildings. Regency style in candy 
colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier version of the 
60's preserved in aspic, where --

Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:

					ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... The War Office today approved military 
			expenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
			system. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
			matter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
			Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was 
			still necessary in the uncertain climate.

As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, 
ordinary life does not intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to 
spoil the view.

As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --

41EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN

Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --

42INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN

but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

A large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
Titles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his 
drinks cabinet. Pours a brandy.  Hears a noise ...

Instantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  
Steed peers 'round a corner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his 
desk -- a burglar?
Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

Crack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages 
to dodge, swivel 'round, and --

Bam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of 
blows.  Steed recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the 
area -- bam! a spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn 
back, light floods in -- they freeze.

Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

					STEED
			Brenda -- ?

43FROM ABOVE HIM

a voice --

					MOTHER (O.S.)
			Steed -- ?!

44BACK TO SCENE

Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat 
from the ceiling inches before him --

Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands 
of extendable metal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad 
bodyguard.  Who smiles
seductively.

					STEED
			Mother. I thought you were burglars.

					MOTHER
			Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

					BRENDA
			See how you're getting on ...

					STEED
			Something in the wind?

Mother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls 
around.

					MOTHER
			Weather's turning nasty.

					STEED
			You didn't come to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
			somebody.
				(off Steed's look)
			I expect you'll like her.

Brenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.

					STEED
			'Her'?

45INT.  EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY

A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC 
floats in the air.

Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the 
piano, a framed picture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma 
between Peter and Valentine.

A KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, 
keys jumping up and down automatically, as --

46AT DOOR

Emma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens

47IN CORRIDOR

A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.

					MESSENGER
			Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you ...

Emma shuts the door.  Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card:

					EMMA
				(reads)
			'Please answer the Telephone.'

Emma looks: The phone sits there.

Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A 
recorded message, an upper-class woman's voice:

					WOMAN (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
			Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
			the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
			Steed ...

BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace 
of kippers. Puzzled, she holds up a fish.

					EMMA
			Kippers ...?

48EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY

Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up 
and parks as a car conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  
HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15. Out gets --

-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, 
""Boodles Gentlemen's Club.""  She goes in, passing --

-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.

49INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.

					PORTER
			May I help you, madam ...

					EMMA
			Mr. John Steed, please.

					PORTER
			I'm afraid that's impossible.

					EMMA
			Impossible?

The Porter points to a notice:  ""No non-members.  No animals.  No 
women.""

					PORTER
			You are female?

					EMMA
			As you see.

					PORTER
			Then you can't come in.

					EMMA
			I have an appointment.

					PORTER
			No women. Not in Boodles. Not
			since 1922.

					EMMA
			Really -- what happened in 1922?

Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, 
portraits of dead politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

The Porter rushes up to restrain her.

Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds 
the nerve ends.  The Porter winces and --

					EMMA
			Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
			Steed myself ...

-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru 
double doors, upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on 
her, into

50INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the 
mist, sees --

Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in 
her direction.

					STEED
			Doctor Peel, I presume?

					EMMA
			And you must be Steed. Please
			don't get up.

He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study.

					STEED
			I was about to throw in the towel.

					EMMA
			I had a spot of bother at the door.

					STEED
			I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
			inside Boodles since --

					EMMA
			1922. Why the kippers?

					STEED
			Red herring would have been too
			obvious, don't you think?

					EMMA
				(looks around)
			So what was all this -- some sort
			of test?

					STEED
			Congratulations, you've penetrated a 
			bastion of male privilege. I guessed 
			you weren't a stickler for Tradition, 
			doctor.

					EMMA
			Whereas you are.

					STEED
			Dyed in the wool. But I can admire 
			someone who doesn't play by the 
			rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					STEED
			Not by me. Play by the rules,
			Doctor, or the game is nothing.

					EMMA
			And just what is the game?

					STEED
			I say, this is all terribly formal.  
			Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
				(re:  the steamroom) 
			Under the circumstances, you may 
			call me Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Much better.

					EMMA
			And now that we've settled the matter 
			of honorifics, will you kindly explain 
			why you wished me to meet you?

					STEED
			I didn't. Mother did.

					EMMA
			Mother?

Steed steps closer, smiling.

					STEED
			I expect you'll like him.

Off Emma's reaction --

51EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

CAR ROAR OVER.  Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the 
sleek Jaguar zooms at 60mph.  Steed dodges traffic --

Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters 
pedestrians, HONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  
Steed turns charmingly.

					STEED
			Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't
			be late.
				(beat)
			A word of warning. Don't take the
			macaroon. Mother's favorite.

Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance 
by the riverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

			RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
					No Admittance

At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: 
""Security -- Top Priority Clearance Only.""  The barrier lifts.  She 
looks again at Steed, reappraising him as Big Ben approaches four.  The 
car disappears in darkness ...

52LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN

opens, revealing water!  We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish 
float past a window of reinforced glass.  An original Campbell's tomato 
soup can floats down as we
WIDEN to reveal ...

53INT. SECRET SERVICE HQ - UNDERWATER - DAY

Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.

					MOTHER
			That's better. I much prefer a
			womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
			Peel?

A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.

Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.

					MOTHER
			Shall I be mother?

He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean 
web, known as The Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of 
tunnels.

Catches Emma's wandering lock

					MOTHER
			I expect you're wondering where
			you are.

An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -
- Emma takes her tea ...

					EMMA
			Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret 
			service. You're so hushhush, even the 
			legit secret service knows nothing about 
			it. Am I right?

Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming 
with fancies over to Emma and Steed.

					MOTHER
			Close. We're so hush-hush, even
			we know nothing about it.
				(before Emma can
				make sense of this) 
			Now let's see, there's coconut cake, 
			date and walnut; I recommend the 
			rum baba ...

					EMMA
			Hmmm ...

					MOTHER
			Looks like rain, Steed...

					STEED
			... Showers followed by sunny periods.

					EMMA
				(looks up from
				trolley)
			We're not here to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh, yes we are.

					BRENDA
				(to Emma, cunning)
			Macaroon?

Emma hesitates; takes a cake.  About to take a bite, when --

Mother switches off lights.  A screen drops, covering the water window 
as the mood changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR 
RATTLES on ...

54IN DARKNESS

Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death 
tableaux in the English countryside:

					MOTHER
			We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.  
			We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into 
			the field for data. Case number one: 
			April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins 
			investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.  
			A field outside the village of Little Snoring, 
			one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped 
			by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death 
			in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in 
			perma-frost.
				(the picture changes)
			Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. 
			Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, 
			investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak 
			rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a 
			flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five 
			inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the 
size 
			of a cricket pitch ...
				(the picture changes)
			 ... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief 
			Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip 
			field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins 
			recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, 
			temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous 
			combustion. Not much of him left ...

CLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival:
a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.

					MOTHER
			My number two. Special assignments.  
			She's --

					EMMA
			Let me guess -- 'Father'?

					FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
			All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over 
Emma's face.  Gets the outline.  Emma realizes --

					EMMA
			You're --

Blind ... Father smiles.

					FATHER
			God, you're quick.

					MOTHER
			Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed 
investigates a pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes 
have agent Simkins' name
in them ...

					STEED
			Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My
			shoemaker.

					EMMA
				(unimpressed)
			A kipper. Or a red herring? What were 
			they investigating?

					FATHER
			A series of bizarre shifts in local weather 
			patterns ...

					STEED
			Global warming?

					FATHER
			Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush 
			English village transformed overnight 
			into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

					EMMA
			How curious ...

					MOTHER
			Something strange is happening. And 
			whoever knows about it doesn't want 
			us to find out.

					FATHER
				(to Steed)
			Your mission is simple. Find out
			how and why these agents died.

					EMMA
			I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

					MOTHER
			Your research into climate engineering was 
			state-of-the-art. Your experiments could 
			have revolutionized our knowledge of global 
			warming -- had they succeeded. We need 
			your expertise.

					STEED
			Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor 
			again, Mrs. Peel --

Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...

					EMMA
			I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.  
			I've been out of action for some time. I'll 
			consider your proposal.

She gets up, ready to go.

					FATHER
			One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another 
			special reason we wanted you to join our 
			happy family; rather curious, actually ...

Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru 
image clarification, identikit sketches.

					MOTHER
			Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.  
			One description tallied in all three places.  
			Recognize her?

Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.

					EMMA
			Me, isn't it?

Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister.

					FATHER
			Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.  
			With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

					EMMA
			You're saying I have no choice.

					MOTHER
			Father will be your controller. Steed here 
			will show you the ropes.

					EMMA
				(very arch)
			Ropes?

Emma, who works at reloading as

					STEED
			Think she really killed those agents?

					MOTHER
			She may not know. Theory goes she
			may be very ill.

					STEED
			Amnesia?

					MOTHER
			Possibly. Split personality ...

					STEED
			Insane ... ?

					MOTHER
			Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, 
			you should watch out.

					STEED
			Why?

					MOTHER
			She may try to kill you.

57IN SHOOTING GALLERY

Emma swiftly turns, aims, and --

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision.  All 
on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp.

					STEED
			Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. 
			Darling.

58INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on 
Warhol's Jackie (1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- 
blown up, dissected, analyzed.  The swirling newspaper dots cover 
Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.

As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy 
Ops) -- a kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his 
thick dark glasses and beard,
Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.

					DR. DARLING
			One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
			she's obsessively devoted to the memory 
			of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. 
			You may find her a little ... remote.

Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him.

					DR. DARLING
			They were a team. Met at Cambridge. 
			Working on a top secret research mission 
			into weather conditions, code name The
			Prospero Project, when Peel died.

Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.

					MOTHER
			Something went wrong. System malfunction.  
			Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.  
			Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File 
			still open.

					STEED
			How come you took so much interest
			in her, Dr. Darling?

					DR. DARLING
			Her husband was one of ours.

					STEED
				(eyes Peel's photo,
				then Mother)
			Peel? Did she know?

					MOTHER
			Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She 
			was in a dangerous game, Steed. High 
			stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If 
			she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

					STEED
			Anyone particular in mind?

					MOTHER
			You.

OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...

59INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she 
does, Emma is a champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to 
cables -- very high-tech 
dueling ...

Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...

					STEED
			You're a lady of hidden talents,
			Mrs. Peel ...

Tic-tac ...

					EMMA
			I've no intention of hiding them ...

Tic-tac ...

					STEED
			Scientist ...
				(tic-tac)
			... marksman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... swordsman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... To what do you attribute your 
			overachievements?

Fast swordplay.  Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.  Steed's good, too.

					EMMA
			My father always wanted a boy.

					STEED
			Really?  I fail to see the connection.

					EMMA
			I had a feeling you would. Touche!

She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.  BUZZ!  
Steed removes his mask; holds her foil tip.

					STEED
			I take your point.

Emma takes off her mask.

					EMMA
			Do you?

					STEED
			Yes indeed. I need protection.

60EXT.  SIGN - DAY

""Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756.""  Steed's Jag parked in front 
-- of course there's a space.  Getting out

					EMMA
			I thought we were on our way.

					STEED
			Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man 
			worth meeting. No point setting out 
			half shod.

					EMMA
				(dry)
			Or half cocked.

61CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.  The ""lasts"" shapes of shoes beside 
him -- bear Steed's name.

					STEED
			I couldn't agree more. Thank you, 
			Trubshaw.

					TRUBSHAW
				(significantly)
			Very good, Mr. Steed.

WIDEN to reveal:

62INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

A bull moose's antlers.  A horned rhino.  A Leopard.  A tiger.  Then 
next to them, in a wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently 
beneath them.  Shop assistants attend in tails and wing-collars, very 
old school tie.  Steed emerges helped into a new flashy waistcoat ...

					EMMA
				(gags at the waistcoat)
			Steed, we really must be --

					STEED 
				(relishing his shoes)
			Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a 
			hand-made shoe. As unique as a face 
			or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?

63BEHIND DISPLAY

Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...

					EMMA
			You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

					STEED
			Thank you, Trubshaw ...

A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, 
smart suit, druggy high-pitched giggle.  BAILEY, a cocky, cool 
psychopath.  He watches Steed and Emma leave ...

... and saunters after them ...  CAR ROAR OVER.

64EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.

					EMMA (V.O.)
			That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Do you really think so?

Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now 
painted pink and guarded by female grenadiers ...

65SIGN

reading:  ""Scotland"" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the 
Jag ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Press that button, would you?
			Tea?

66CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-
warmed pot, pouring into two china cups ...

WIDEN to reveal:

67INT.  JAG - DAY

Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...

					STEED
			Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
			your flow of oratory ...

Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...

					EMMA
			You know what I mean. This car
			-- and you. Nobody walks around
			like that. Milk?

					STEED
			Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
			Peel. No thank you.

She hands over a cup.

					EMMA
			But why? What's the point?

					STEED
			A Gentleman has to have a code.
			This is part of mine. A uniform.
			Think of it as my suit of shining
			armor.

					EMMA
			And I suppose you're the knight.

					STEED
			The most unpredictable piece on
			the board. And always ready to
			protect his queen.

					EMMA
			That's predictable. When I find
			a queen in need of protection
			I'll let you know.

Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing?

					STEED
			I'm hoping you will.

He puts his foot down.  Zoom ...

68EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car 
...

69INT.  JAG - DAY

Emma consults a list, reads --

					EMMA
			Sir August Merryweather ... why
			are we seeing him first?

					STEED
			As per mother's instructions.

					EMMA
			Do we always follow Mother's
			instructions?

					STEED
			For a man in my position --

					EMMA
			Just what is your position, if you don't 
			mind my asking.  How did a stuffed 
			shirt like you get into this line of work?

					STEED
				(smiles)
			They call me in when they've reached a 
			dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

					EMMA
			I have no choice. Why should you
			risk your life?

					STEED
			After our fencing match, I was rather 
			hoping you would do the risking.  
			More tea?

					EMMA
			No thanks.

					STEED
			I meant me.

Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours.

70EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.

					STEED (V.O.)
			According to Mother, Sir August owns 
			half of the Highlands. A millionaire.  
			Former head of Special Projects at the 
			Ministry. Now ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			An eccentric recluse?

71INT.  JAG - DAY

					STEED
			Not so much eccentric. More barking 
			mad. He has a wife called June. And 
			a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

					EMMA
			June, July ... August?

					STEED
			The family does seem to be somewhat 
			meteorologically inclined.

					EMMA
			Any other vices?

					STEED
			All of a piece, really. A fanatical 
			weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
				(off her look)
			British Royal Organisation For
			Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British 
			weather has been tampered with 
			by ... aliens.

Emma takes this in.

					EMMA
			So ... I distract him while you snoop 
			around? How?

					STEED
			Small talk.  Try the weather.

72EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates

Signs:  ""Private: No Admittance.""  Guards in hunting gear and plus 
fours, with loaded rifles.  They start up the drive ...

Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.

One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the 
WHIR of a CAMERA ...

The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.

73INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING 
BAGPIPES on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal:

A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --

-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large 
teddy bear outfit with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of 
armor.

					EMMA
			Original ...

					BUTLER
			This way, miss ...

					EMMA
			Missus ...

He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into

74INT.  A LARGE ROOM

of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls 
lined with display cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, 
spiders.  A thermometer reads:

100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.

Emma fans herself.  Nobody in the roam.  But hears a sound of RAINFALL 
from a smoked glass conservatory.

					EMMA
			Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Eh? In here!

Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.

75INT.  CONSERVATORY

beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in 
bizarre rubber togs.  Emma stays cool.

					EMMA
			I've come to apply for membership
			in Brolly --

					SIR AUGUST
				(shouts above the tempest)
			You don't get rain like you used to in 
			England. A good shower that's the ticket.  
			Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells 
			the namby-pamby in a man.

SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.  A belted rubber 
macintosh, flippers, goggles.  He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES 
DOWN --

					EMMA
			I so agree. How did you acquire a 
			taste for it?

					SIR AUGUST
			Out in India. So character-forming for the 
			British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The 
			rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen 
			inches overnight. A whole week of lovely 
			rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.

					SIR AUGUST
			You

					EMMA
			Have we met?

					SIR AUGUST
			You mean you don't recall??

Before Emma can reply, the door opens...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, Lady June ...

Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester 
and galoshes, who wheels in a tray of scones.

					LADY JUNE
			Dear August.  Loves his showers.
			Like a baby.
				(beat)
			Scones, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you, Lady -- June ...

Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is 
rapidly 
darkening ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

					EMMA
			Promised? Who promised?

					SIR AUGUST
			There, look!

Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.  Emma 
exchanges looks with June as the rain starts pouring.

					SIR AUGUST
			Imagine being caught out in a blow 
			like that!

76EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his 
umbrella; wanders over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  ""No 
Trespassers.""  Rains more.  And more. Turns to a tempest, as --

					STEED
			I say, this is a bit much.

Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.  He looks 
over, peers through the mist at --

A deep purple cloud.  Mushrooming towards him.

Steed can't escape it.  It envelops him.  Starts to blink.  Cough.  
Footsteps less sure.  Surrounded by thick purple haze

Steed stumbles and falls

Down a hill.  Tumbles to the bottom.  He knocks his head on a rock.  
Steed blinks, shakes his head.  Eyes refocus.  He sees

77UNDULATING SAND DUNES

Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.  Dead trees.  Suddenly 
Steed's in the Sahara.  A heat haze shimmers.

Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...

78IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX

Steed heads towards it.  The PHONE BOX seems further away.  Like an 
optical illusion.  Then hears RINGING.

Steed still bowler-hatted.  Overcoat.  Perspiring.  Takes off bowler, 
wipes brow.  Adjusts rose in buttonhole.  It wilts.

He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.  Steed picks up the 
RINGING PHONE, listens to --

A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of ""The Merry Widow.""

					STEED
			'The Merry Widow'...?

Over the MUSIC, a strange --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
			hell...? Who is this? ... You must
			leave the test area. I repeat,
			leave the area ... Help is on the
			way ...

CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Steed is baffled.  Steps out, sees --

79ON HORIZON

a shimmering heat haze.  A figure on a camel moving towards them.  
Steed watches amazed, as the camel pads closer ...

The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. 
She draws closer. Drops the veils to reveal --

Emma Peel.  In her black leather catsuit.

					.STEED
			Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. 
			And I see you're wearing your - 
			riding outfit?

Emma moves closer.  Steed smiles at her.  Emma closer and -- chop! -- 
gives a kung-fu jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the 
stomach.  As Steed lies on the 
ground --

					STEED
			Manners, Mrs. Peel.

Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS --

80EMMA'S POV

 -- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back 
on the sands.  Eyes close ...

81EMMA

moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. 
Blows a good-bye kiss.

82STEED'S POV82

The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him.

										FADE TO 
BLACK.

Sound of CLACKING ...

FADE IN:

83INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red 
leather), her spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of 
tea to

Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering 
over him.  Very nonchalant.  Eating his grapes.

					STEED
			Ah, Brenda ...
				(as she leaves)
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			You should be dead.  How do you
			feel?

					STEED
				(eyes her)
			Strange.

					EMMA
			You were very lucky.  Four shots to 
			the heart. I found you after I slipped 
			away from Sir August. Mother brought 
			you here. Not me you should thank.

					STEED
			I wasn't about to.

					EMMA
			I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your
			bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought 
			you were just overdressed.

					STEED
			I might say the same.

84FROM GALLERY

Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to 
a whisper.  But they both are wearing headphones.

					EMMA
			Mother and Dr. Darling have me 
			under observation. They think I 
			tried to kill you.

					STEED
			Why should they think that?

					EMMA
			You told them. You said I arrived 
			on a camel, shot you four times. 
			Left you for dead.

					STEED
			Frankly that's how I remember it.

					EMMA
			But that's absurd. I may not be 
			over-fond of you, Steed, but it's 
			not my style.

					STEED
			Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
			Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
				(conceding)
			That's possible. Sir August was convinced 
			he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.  
			Another odd thing. When it rained, he said 
			it was just as someone had promised.

					STEED
			Did he say who?

					EMMA
			No. But he must know. Incidentally, 
			my double left you with this.

Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  
He looks puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. ""The Wonderland 
Corporation,"" followed by --

					STEED
			An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

					EMMA
			Did you say formal? I must dress.

85EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets 
out, opens her door. Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her 
leather suit --

86CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --

					STEED
			I must say, you look more your
			old self --

					EMMA
			You mean my other self ...

					STEED
			Either way ... may I ask: why
			you dress in that fashion?

					EMMA
			I should have thought that was
			obvious ...
				(off his smirk)
			I'm in mourning.

She moves off.  Stay on his poker face.

					STEED
			I can't wait to see afternoon.

He joins her; they survey the building.

					EMMA
			Where's the picnic?

They look up to --

87INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling --

Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  
Ridiculous and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, 
green.  Furry, giant paws and ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a 
familiar tartan ...

On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, 
birthday cakes.  And wrapped presents before each.

Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. 
pinned to their fur.  A children's tune, ""THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC,"" 
plays.  Followed by -
a gavel rapping order.

A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which 
ECHOES through our story --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Today is history. The first day of the future. 
			I welcome you to the first general meeting 
			of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied 
			with our colleagues from Brolly ...

Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			You have all given time, money and expertise 
			to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a 
			new phase of our operation. From today, 
			many of you will no longer be needed. I have 
			to warn you ...

Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... 
			A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is 
			no longer secret. Agents are investigating 
			us. Their names are John Steed and Emma 
			Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us 
			... perhaps more than one ...

Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of ""Who?"" (*PS: One of the Teddys 
is a giant rabbit who seems especially alarmed).

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			That remains to be seen. When we find 
			the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

					TEDDY BEAR #l
			These agents.  Where are they?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Here. In this building. By our estimate, they 
			will enter this room in thirty-five point five 
			seconds precisely ...

Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I am sorry the party is over.  But we 
			shall meet again.
			To each of you a gift. A token of
			my appreciation.

In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in 
paper with a pink and silver bow.

The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans.

88INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT

UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to 
the conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an 
empty room. Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting 
where formerly the big ones sat; the teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING 
again OVER ...

One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it:

89TINY EMMA PEEL

in black leather.

					STEED (O.S.)
			For you, Mrs. Peel.

90BACK TO SCENE

Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address.

					EMMA
			Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
			Terrace ...

91INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT

Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated 
hammer and sickle tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies 
discarded in elegant living rooms.

Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.

They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up 
with distaste.  Then moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage 
bottle of champagne --

					STEED
				(admiringly)
			Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
				(then puzzled)
			But he bites the end of his
			Monte Cristos ... ?
				(frowning)
			Clearly, we're dealing with a
			maniac.

Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --

92NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV

where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  
A few pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy 
bear outfit.

93BACK TO SCENE

Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.

					STEED
			Colonel Crabtree. International
			Satellite Systems. Formerly of
			the Ministry.

					EMMA
			How on earth can you tell?

Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name.

					STEED
			Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
			isn't the only shoemaker still
			practicing his trade ...

					EMMA
			Very good, Steed ...

A MEWLING SOUND.

					EMMA
			What's that?

Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into

94ANOTHER ROOM

Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.

95STEED

looks up as Emma emerges with - 

A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly.

					STEED
			What on earth?

					EMMA
			Any ideas?

					STEED
			Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
			Zoological Society ...

					EMMA
			Is that written in his shoe?

					STEED
				(smug)
			Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(shrugs)
			She had this in her mouth. There,
			there...

Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside 
-- another address:  84 Cadogan Place.

					STEED
			Not again.  There's got to be
			another. way to go about this.

96EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) - NIGHT

Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before 
gliding through an open French window --

97INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military 
memorabilia.  Busts of Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  
Desks.  Meanwhile --


98INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... 
licking, pawing him ...

					STEED
			Now, now ...
				(sings)
			'I can't give you anything but
			love, baby...'

99INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

Emma searching ...

100OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR100

		a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence.

101INSIDE - EMMA

finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks 
up, in front of her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  
Ready to strike --

Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and --

Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him 
over her shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --

The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy 
grabs a military sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at 
Emma's head.  She ducks.  The sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another 
sabre; the fight is on!

Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes 
flying off!  Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily.

Emma's eyes widen as:

A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.

Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...

Emma's out.

102INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles 
down Steed's chin ...

103INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his 
teddy costume.  Throws clothes into a suitcase.

The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Naughty teddy ...

					MAN
			No! You can't ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings, it rings for thee ...

					MAN
			But I've got rid of her.  She's ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Go to the window ... To the window.

Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING.

Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  
Direct hit.  The teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very 
dead.  Kinda like the
other guy ...

104IN OTHER ROOM

Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, 
sees dead Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...

					EMMA
			Major D'Arcy ... ?

105OVER HER SHOULDER

from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another 
""Emma"" --

-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a 
NOISE.  Emma turns just in time to see.

					EMMA
			Well, well. If it isn't me ...

Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out 
the window ... she wears the same black catsuit.

The real Emma rushes, follows her ""double""

Clambers outside to rappel up the line to

106EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop 
maze of buildings, flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, 
griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner 
to see --

Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a 
million bulbs ... giant neon signs ...

Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.  A twinge of vertigo.  
Then she looks up, hears a NOISE -- From:

107BEHIND GARGOYLE

she sees her ""double"" run.  Emma gives chase.

Hot pursuit.  Over rooftops.  'Round wires.  PAST neon signs high over 
the city ...

Emma follows.  Gains on the ""double,"" who --

Pushes faster.  Gliding between rooftop buildings.  Dodging, weaving.  
But Emma gains more.  Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, 
until --

108EMMA'S POV

as she sees her ""double"" leap over a yawning chasm.  And stumble on the 
other side for a footing.

109BACK TO SCENE

as Emma's adrenaline surges.  She cannot stop, she --

Jumps!  Hangs in the air.  Limbs pushing out for the edge.  And only 
just, she lands perfectly, gaining, closing, until --

110ON NEXT ROOFTOP

Emma gains up close.  A final burst of acceleration.  Then without 
warning, her ""double"" --

Turns, Emma catches up, and --

Wham!  Wham!  A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- 
Emma reacts swiftly, surges into overdrive --

In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- 
a flurry of kicks as Emma --

Lands on her back.  The ""double"" attacks.  Emma retaliates --

Kicks up her leg -- flings the ""double"" over her head she lands 
awkwardly -- a METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks 
herself up without pausing

And vanishes into the rooftop maze.

111AGAINST SKYLINE

Emma stands.  Looks.   She's lost her ""double.""  She stands alone, 
silhouetted against the night sky.

Caught in the moonlight.  Above sparks of neon.  Daunting, muscular, 
poised for action, as --

Ears listening to distant noises.  SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.  FLUTTER of BIRD 
WING.  HUM of WIND through wires.  Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --

112EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE

above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.  Slowly 
wound  tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --

113BACK TO SCENE - EMMA

looks 'round.  Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming 
seconds 
before --

Through the air --

114EMMA'S POV

a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly 
enough as --

115BACK TO SCENE

as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, 
crushing air from her, as the wire --

Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her 
and dangles her over the city.  She looks down.

A long way.

Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.  She drops down to 
the rooftop ...

Slithers down the roof.  Slips --

116OVER LEDGE

Emma hangs on with fingertips.

Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:

117ADVERTISEMENT

for ""Wonderland Weather"" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high 
bikini-clad ""Emma"" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: ""COMING 
SOON -- THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER.""

118BACK TO SCENE

Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at ""herself.""  The surreal repetition 
of the loop.  Overlooking the whole city.

Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.  Just when from --

119ABOVE HER

an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --

Another CABLE for her to hold.  It uncoils down past the windows, 
telltale SPARKS flare up as it hits metal --

Emma tries to grab for it.  Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE 
CABLE -- a thousand VOLTS surge through her body --

 -- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --

120STRIPED AWNING

on a lower ledge.  She hangs precariously.  Catching her breath.  About 
to redouble her efforts.  When beside her from a --

121BALCONY WINDOW

an umbrella extended.  Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.  They are back 
in Teddy's 
flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.  He helps her up -- hands her 
a phone.

					STEED
			For you, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Thanks ...
				(dry)
			I see what you mean about letting
			me do the risking ... Hello?

It's Sir August.

					SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
			Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
			you everything ... The weather's
			getting worse and worse ... they're
			after me ... coming for me ... come
			quickly!

CLICK.

					EMMA
			Sir August...?
				(to Steed)
			What now?

					STEED
			Ask Mother.

Sound OVER:  RING-RING.

122INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY

Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG 
BARKS. Finally, Sir August answers.

					SIR AUGUST
			Mrs. Peel -- ?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings ...

					SIR AUGUST
			No, please! I beg you ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Walk over to the window ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Let it be rain, please let it be --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Stay by the window. By the window.

Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, 
too late.

123OUTSIDE

a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  
Then a LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --

BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes
in ...

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Emergency alert ...

124EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY

PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car 
tootles down deserted streets.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
			Completely unpredicted ...

125INSIDE CAR

					EMMA
			Where's Mother?

					FATHER
			Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't 
			take chances. I'm looking after 
			things while he's hiding out ...

Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.

					FATHER
			You're probably wondering how I 
			can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new 
			prototype from the boys in X division.  
			Micro-sensors in the system read 
			signals and road information. Converts 
			the info into miles per hour. 
			Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  
Not that smart.  Steed holds onto his hat.

					STEED
			We know one thing. That suspect
			was not Mrs. Peel.

					FATHER
			So you say ... 

					EMMA
			You don't believe him?

					FATHER
			It's Mother you have to convince.
			He's very agitated.  Wait here.

Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue

Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...

					EMMA
			But

					STEED
			Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's 
cap is -- the bodyguard, Brenda.

					BRENDA
			Fares, please,

126INT.  BUS - DAY

Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay 
Brenda, the conductor.  Go upstairs.

127UPSTAIRS

is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks 
on electronic panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper 
windows have been blacked out.

					MOTHER
			Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's 
			turning quite nasty. Sir August was 
			blown to smithereens. Along with 
			half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's 
			worried.

					EMMA
			He tried to warn us ...

					STEED
			We had a lead to Wonderland
			Weather but we got there too late.
			Someone tipped them off ...

					MOTHER
			Too late anyway. Today's escapade 
			was only for starters. This is no 
			ordinary weather. It's manmade. A 
			kind of weather bomb.

					STEED
			Impossible.

					EMMA
			Not quite. This is my field.

					STEED
			Is there anything that isn't?

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			The Prospero Project was started by 
			my husband. It was an early attempt 
			to solve the problems of global warming.  
			In theory, climate engineering is entirely 
			feasible. We thought of injecting a 
			chemical cocktail into the atmosphere 
			by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

					STEED
			Filling in mother nature's blind
			spots ... ?

					EMMA
			Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts 
			to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.  
			Propane gas mostly. In small quantities 
			it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone 
			layer. But it proved impractical. 
			Too bulky ...

					STEED
			But if someone miniaturized the
			process...

					EMMA
			That's what we were working on.

					STEED
			Sounds as if someone's hijacked
			your research.

					MOTHER
			Would it be possible to use it for
			military purposes?

					EMMA
			Directed by laser. Bounced by
			satellite. Quite possible.

					STEED
			Where would they aim for?

Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, 
sits down again.  No one pays any attention.

					MOTHER
			London. The World Council of Ministers 
			meets soon on global defence. If you can 
			control the weather, you control the world.

					EMMA
			After the cold war ...

					STEED
			The hot and cold war ...

Sign ""Grand Opening Soon.""  WIDEN to reveal ...

128EXT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...

129INT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

A kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.

At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed 
sneaks in, moves behind a screen, overhears --

A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist

					BAILEY
			New orders. The penultimate phase. 
			Now fully operational ...

Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives 
inside --

130INT.  WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY

A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --

Virtual reality weather:  clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.  
And slogans: 
""Be natural.  Act natural.  Think natural.  The natural beauty of 
Wonderland Weather.""

Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near 
Harrods ...

Steed finds a desk.  Inspects papers.  Sees a postcard of a large 
stately home.  He pockets it.  Then looks 'round to see --

Bailey before him.  We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.  
Neither gives away the other.

					BAILEY
			We're not yet open for business,
			I'm afraid.

					STEED
			Shame. I was recommended. By a
			friend.

					BAILEY
			Really?

					STEED
			Sir August Merryweather? I was
			looking for something relaxing.
			Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

					BAILEY
			Normally, we'd be eager to
			oblige --

					STEED
			Seriously?  

					BAILEY
			Of course. Natural weather delivered
			to your door on demand. Down your
			phoneline. For limited periods.

					STEED
			You don't say. How real does it feel?

					BAILEY
			As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
			Humid or dry. Anything you like.
			Within reason.

					STEED
			There are limits?

					BAILEY
			The technology is brand new. Soon 
			it will be more powerful. We 
			anticipate a huge demand. Leave us 
			your number. We'll be in touch.

					STEED
			No need. I'll call again.

Steed raises his bowler.  Bailey watches him go.

131EXT.  WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY

Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:  
""Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd."" as --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			My car. I'll drive.

132EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...

					STEED (V.O.)
			A day in the country ...

133INT.  LOTUS - DAY

					EMMA
			Three agents killed by bad weather...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret 
			defense establishment. A group of 
			eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything 
			points to you.  No sisters?  No 
			undiscovered twin?

					EMMA
			Not that I know of.  Explanation?

					STEED
			According to Dr. Darling, you're a 
			psychopathic personality with 
			schizophrenic delusions, suffering from 
			recurring amnesia based on traumatic 
			repression, leading to outbursts of 
			anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt.

					EMMA
			Is that what you think?

					STEED
			Oh, well ...
				(beat)
			Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

134EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY

The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train 
at a level crossing, which just misses them --

135INT. LOTUS - DAY

Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --

					STEED
			Do you always drive this fast?

					EMMA
			Have I trespassed on a male
			prerogative?
				(before his reply)
			We're being followed. I saw him
			at Trubshaw's ...

Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, 
trying to catch up. Emma glances in the mirror, and --

					EMMA
			Hold on ...

Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back 
to his seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind.

136EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY

The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  
Emma tries to shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  
Shaking 'round corners, as ...

137BEND

before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind 
struggles to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --

And suddenly sees in front of her --

138HUGE TRUCK

crossing directly in their path!

					STEED
			Turn!

139EMMA

swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely 
hidden as --

140TRUCK

clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.

141ON HAYSTACK

as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a 
basket appears ...

					OLD LADY
			Are you alright, young man?

					STEED
			I think so, thank you so much ...

A SQUEAL of TIRES as -

The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as 
Steed and the Old Lady react ...

					BAILEY
				(relishing)
			Reach for the sky, pardner.

Steed raises his hands.

					OLD LADY
			Oh, dear --

To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and

BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun 
spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is 
unfazed.

					OLD LADY
			Cocky little bastard. I hope he
			was a baddy.

					STEED
			I feel sure of it.

					OLD LADY
			I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
			on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

					STEED
				(looks around)
			She was ...

They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...

					OLD LADY
			You with Mother or Father?

					STEED
			Both, actually.

					OLD LADY
			Good. Glad to see they're together at last.  
			They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.  
			Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

					STEED
				(not paying attention)
			You don't say.
				(mumbles)
			Like looking for a needle in a ...

142INSIDE HAYSTACK

Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He 
tries to conceal his relief at seeing her.

					STEED
			What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
			breathing?

					EMMA
			Barely.

					STEED
			You will let me know if you find
			that queen who's in need of
			protection, won't you?

He pulls her out.  She's annoyed.

143OUTSIDE HAYSTACK

Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.

					EMMA
				(holding it ruefully)
			This must be the last straw.

					STEED
				(takes one off
				her back)
			Here's the one that broke the
			camel's back.

					EMMA
			Someone didn't want us to get to
			the party.

					STEED
			I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

					OLD LADY
			I may be able to help you.

144EXT.  STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

comes to life.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...

					STEED
				(checks postcard)
			Wonderland Weather Ltd.

					OLD LADY
			This way ...

145EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY

On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.  A MECHANICAL CLICK, 
its eyes conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old 
Lady, who've landed inside the walled grounds.  They move stealthily 
forward, unaware ...

					OLD LADY
			Over here ...

The Old Lady waves them on.  They enter a tunnel into

146MAZE

Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.  
They follow the path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends 
and U-turns.  At first intrigued ...

Then perplexed.  Emma leads the way, Steed following.  The Old Lady 
slips OUT OF VIEW.  Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.  
Emma rushes ahead.

					EMMA
			Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
			trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
			diagonal paths and a single
			curving path. A late Seventeenth
			Century design, originally for
			King William of Orange, copied...
			Ah ...

Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.  He pursues her.  Glimpses her.  
Then loses her.  Another glimpse.  Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly 
--

Thru the other side of the hedge.  In two places at once.

					STEED
			... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
			double again.

Out of sight, Emma rushes on.  Around her, the hedges grow taller.  She 
seems to grow smaller.  Emma begins to realize things are not what they 
seem.  As she pushes her way thru --

147FROM ABOVE

the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.

									DISSOLVE THRU TO:

148INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A pattern on a screen.  The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract 
lines.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.  Someone, 
somewhere is watching them.  Laughter, then a familiar voice --

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Now this is more like it ...

149EXT.  MAZE - DAY

Steed searches for an exit.

150ANOTHER PART OF MAZE

Emma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  
She follows down a path strewn with leaves.

As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.

151INT.  RABBIT HOLE

Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...

					EMMA
			Steed ... !

					STEED (V.O.)
			Mrs. Peel ... ?

152EXT.  MAZE - DAY

The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --

Steed studies the classical statue ...

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... ?

Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

Emma walking towards him.  She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly 
coils an arm around his neck.  Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes 
-- kisses him full an the
mouth.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... !
				(more kiss)
			Mrs. Peel ...

The kiss ends.  Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her 
lipstick.  His tongue traces his lips; smarts ...

					STEED
			Your lipstick ...

Poison.  He goes dizzy.  Steed collapses to the ground.

153INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

Inside the house, a grand hall.  Deserted.  A cobweb hangs from 
ceiling.  A velvet curtain tattered and torn.
Emma.

A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.  Ahead, the real Emma sees --

A giant staircase.  There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
She picks it up.  Puts it in a pocket.  Emma goes --

154UPSTAIRS

Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.  One of herself in 
ornate aristocratic regalia.

155LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS

Rooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.

156INSIDE ROOMS

A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets 
... ventriloquists' dummies... and ...

Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from 
the blackness ...

Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens 
or fossils.  Emma picks up one snow scene.

She shakes it.

157EXT.  HOUSE

as if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in.

158IN MAZE

A drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open.

					STEED
				(re: rain)
			Not again.

He rises, looks down, reacts --

Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... 
Steed kneels, next to her in the rain

					OLD LADY
			It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
			Tell Father.

She dies in his arms.

Wind picks up, too.

Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --

159INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY

THUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a 
CHILDHOOD TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems 
to grow darker.

160FROM BEHIND

Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:

					VOICE (V.O.)
			I wouldn't shake that too hard.
			The weather might turn nasty.

From the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  
His shape and
face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker.

					EMMA
			Quite a collection.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			If nature gives a man a collector's mind, 
			it doesn't matter what he collects.  
			Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. 
			A true collector grows more obsessive 
			as the years pass.

Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...

					EMMA
			Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
			We have met ...

From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:

Peter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER.

					EMMA
			Peter ... ?

Instinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause.

					EMMA
			I must be dreaming ...

Emma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it 
over his heart.  BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

					PETER
			Listen... Very much alive.

Peter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but 
alarmed, disbelief.  Peter raises her hand to his lips.

					PETER
			Darling, it's me...

Emma shudders, battles with herself.

					EMMA
			Peter ...

Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.

161CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES

Inside her pupil --

										FLASH CUTS 
TO:

162MEMORY FLASHES

His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking 
-- the glass obscuring his face.

163BACK TO SCENE

					EMMA
			Impossible ... how?

Peter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious.

					PETER
			For you ... all for you ...

Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his 
hands.  Emma leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their 
eyes, until --

Lips parted.  Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --

					PETER
			Don't be afraid, darling.

She turns, runs to the door.  Like a trapped bird.  She tries the door 
-- locked.  Another door -- locked.  A window -- locked.

					PETER
			Don't run away. I forgive you, 
			Emma. I know you left me. But 
			I still love you. Do you still have 
			my ring? I need it.

Peter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before 
her, pleading with her.  Seductive yet nightmarish.

As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --

The big window overlooking the gardens.  She runs, leaps, and in SLOW 
MOTION --

Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, 
as she --

164EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY

somersaults through the window down to the ground.  Lands with a THUD 
on the wet ground.  Looks up to see --

Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.

					EMMA
			Steed!

She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.

					STEED
			Oh, no. First time, shame on
			you. Third time, shame on me.

He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is 
			suffering from delusions and 
			hallucinations. An extreme personality 
			disorder. She imagines her husband 
			Peter Peel has come back to her ...

CLOSE ON Emma's face.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			A classic syndrome, to overcome her 
			subconscious guilt at her other crimes.  
			We've attached her to the dreamscape 
			machine. We'll soon see what her 
			unconscious looks like...

Emma's eyes flicker...

Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating 
her grapes ...

Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.  A STEADY PULSE DRONE.  Tugs at 
leather straps.  No use.  WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special 
couch --

Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out 
into a Dreamscape machine.  Drowsy, disoriented.

					EMMA
			Where am I?

					STEED
			The Winslow Home for Retired
			Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
			I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
			forgive me. I thought you were
			someone else ...

					EMMA
			Was I?

					STEED
				(no smile)
			I expect that's for you to know
			and me to find out ...

					EMMA
			It was Peter -- I saw him ...

Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.  FOCUS CHANGES TO --

165ABOVE HER

A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig 
zag op-art effects a la Bridget Riley.

She blinks.

										DISSOLVE 
TO:

166SAME SCENE - LATER

Steed is gone.  Dr. Darling leans over her.  Emma stares at the 
hypnodisc.  Closes her eyes.

167EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES

Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out 
via wires to --

168UP ON WALL

A ""Dreamscape"" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random 
images from Emma's unconscious.  Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card 
views -- childhood 
snaps --

169BESIDE ""BED""

Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her 
ring.  During the interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- 
tries to remove the ring without arousing her suspicion.  Pulls gently 
on it.

170UP IN GALLERY

In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.

					MOTHER
			This man -- did you see him?

					STEED
			No. Her husband, she says. Alice
			tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
			Mother beware. Tell Father
			That's all.

171BY COUCH

Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.

172FROM HER POV

He looks and sounds sinister.  From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a 
clip of keys hanging from his pocket.

173BACK TO SCENE

					DR. DARLING
			I want you to say the first thing
			that comes into your head when I
			say these words. Do you
			understand ... ?
				(as she nods)
			Blue ...

					DR. DARLING
			Love...

					EMMA
			... death ...

Steed watching, listening ...

					DR. DARLING
			Flower ...

					EMMA
			... power ...

The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; 
unlocks her straps.

					DR. DARLING
			Nature ...

					EMMA
			... preserve...

					DR. DARLING
			Secret ...

					EMMA
			... love...

					DR. DARLING
			Hope...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Fear ...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Peter ...

As Emma talks, the ""Dreamscape"" plucks images from her unconscious in 
trippy psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.

					EMMA
			... Piper picked a peck of pickled 
			peppers how many pecks of pickled 
			peppers did Peter Peel -- ?

174CLOSEUP - EMMA

Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble.

					EMMA
			How long have I been here?

					DR. DARLING
			Three days.

Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy.

					EMMA
			Do you get paid by the hour?

Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The 
""Dreamscape"" machine winds down.  Up in the gallery --

BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You are here under observation, 
			Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. 
			Darling's questions

Pushes Dr. Darling aside.

					EMMA
			I resign.

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You
			can't resign.

					EMMA
			Watch me.

Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of 
staring at the hypnodisc.

Emma heads for the airlock door marked:

""ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE""

					MOTHER
			Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!

Fat chance ... she goes in ...

175INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER

Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  
And float helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  
Mother's wheelchair, Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the 
air as Steed tries to reach the ""OFF"" switch

					EMMA
				(echoing)
			What are you trying to do to me?

					MOTHER
				(flailing)
			We want to help...!

					EMMA
			I thought I was a widow. My
			husband ... the only man I ever
			loved ... is dead. For the rest
			of my life I have to live with
			that.

					MOTHER
			The death of Peter Peel was a
			great loss. To us all ...

					EMMA
			To you ... ?

Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the 
""OFF"" switch. They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in 
his wheelchair,
Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother -
-

					STEED
			I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
			explanation ...

Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations.

					MOTHER
			Peter Peel was a first class agent.
			A senior operative.
			'X' department Special operations.  
			He was engaged in top secret research.  
			Top priority.  Government approved.

					EMMA
			The Institute ... the funding ...

					MOTHER
			A cover ... for us.
				(beat)
			I'm sorry...

A turning moment for Emma.  A life lived on a lie.

					EMMA
			So all that time. Our work, our research 
			was for you ... for this? And the 
			accident --

					DARLING
			It was no accident.

					EMMA
			The official investigation ...

					MOTHER
			... was written by me.
				(beat)
			It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.

					EMMA
			Who?

					MOTHER
			Quite frankly ... it could have
			been you.

Silence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

					STEED
			You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
			killing her own husband?

					MOTHER
			Her husband suspected someone very 
			close to the operation. On the day he 
			died, he was setting a test.
			To prove to himself -- to us that his 
			wife was beyond suspicion. He had to 
			be certain. He said he was going to 
			give Mrs. Peel something ...

Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.

					MOTHER
			... I want you to remember. Did
			Peter give you anything on-that 
			day?

176CLOSEUP - EMMA

touches her ring.

177BACK TO SCENE

Emma looks up at Mother.  A barefaced lie.

					EMMA
			No.

Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.

					DR. DARLING
			He said if it vanished, he'd know
			it was ... you who betrayed him.
			He took a huge risk. The ultimate
			test.

					EMMA
			So I'm still ...

					MOTHER
			Under suspicion. Everyone died in 
			the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were 
			the only survivor ...

Mother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts 
uneasily as Emma walks past him to the airlock.

					MOTHER
			This is an official matter, Mrs.
			Peel. No need to take it
			personally. Where are you going?

					EMMA
			To find out who killed my husband.

					MOTHER
			The doors and walls are monitored, 
			Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure 
			establishment.

					EMMA
			So am I.

Emma pushes open the doors.  Walks out.  Down a corridor.  Dr. Darling 
grabs Mother, as he exits with Steed --

					DR. DARLING
			She must remain here. She's
			highly dangerous.

178IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...

					MOTHER
			Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
			Peel. Unfortunately --

					STEED
			Guilty until proven innocent?

					MOTHER
			Mother and Father know best.

Mother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:

					MOTHER
			Something quick. Nothing too ...
			messy.

ON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --

179EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY

Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor 
house, past a sign which reads:

""WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS"" (Butterfly logo)

In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as 
Steed's jag pulls past them in hot pursuit.


180EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Emma speeds down lanes ...

Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.

181INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

Steed looks: a bleep on his radar screen tracks the --

on Emma's shoulder as she drives ...

183EXT.  LANES - DAY

The cars whiz past ...

184INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

Keeping an eye on his radar and the road, Steed switches on the radio.  
The weather forecast:

					RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			'... Sunny intervals leading to
			sudden storms and gale warnings
			for all areas.
				(as he frowns)
			... Outbursts of rain, scattered
			hailstorms and freezing fog
			greeted the World Council of
			Ministers as they arrived in
			London for their conference ...'

Emma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ...

185INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY

A medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, 
illumining Emma as Steed watches her lay --

A red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in 
a pose of eternal sleep:  Peter Peel.

Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed 
watches Emma move away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma 
swivels round -- sees Steed.

					EMMA
			You followed me.

					STEED
			Orders.

					EMMA
			To kill me?

					STEED
				(fractional pause)
			Nothing personal.

Emma smiles. Then turns, and --

Runs!  Steed follows Emma through a door to --

186INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY

Steed enters, glimpses --

Emma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up 
the spiral staircase.  Steed listens, follows.

187UP BELLTOWER

From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris 
falls down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --

188EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

BELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to 
the ledge.  Looks.  A long way down.
From behind --

					EMMA
			A long way down.

Steed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps 
away from the edge, Emma circles him.

					STEED
			Careful. You might fall.

Emma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting 
on the ledge.  Rocking to and fro ...

					EMMA
			I could save you the trouble.

					STEED
			No trouble.

					EMMA
			Because you always obey orders ...

					STEED
			Always.
				(pause)
			Except ...

Steed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge.

					EMMA
			Yes ... ?

					STEED
			... when I don't. It comes down to one 
			thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

Steed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand.

					EMMA
			And do you trust me?

					STEED
			I could be convinced, if ... I knew who 
			poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

					EMMA
			It wasn't me; you have my word.

Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.

					STEED
			I need proof.

Emma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She 
hesitates, then pecks him on the cheek.

					STEED
			It was longer. On the lips.

Emma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  
Steed grabs her hand, pulls her back.

					STEED
			Much longer.  Approximately ...
			fifteen seconds.

Emma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him.

					EMMA
			... Ready?

Steed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... 
Emma looks at her watch.  Counts seconds ...

					EMMA
			... Four ... seven ... ni-...

Then ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  
They stay embracing for fifteen seconds ...

					EMMA
				(aroused)
			Mmm ... what are you doing?

					STEED
			Keeping a stiff upper lip?

					EMMA
			Is that all?

The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  
With an effort, she regains her composure.  A long silence.

					EMMA
			So I'm in the clear?

Steed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all.

					EMMA
			But you did suspect me.

					STEED
			Not for a moment.

					EMMA
			You're playing games.

					STEED
			Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			I thought you played by the rules.

					STEED
			I thought you didn't.

					EMMA
			I'm playing to win.

					STEED
			Winning isn't everything.

					EMMA
			Please don't tell me it's how you
			play the game.

					STEED
				(smiles; stands
				aside)
			After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

Steed motions down the stairs.  It's close to the edge.

					EMMA
			No, after you.

					STEED
				(back to square
				one)
			You don't trust me?

					EMMA
			As far as you trust me.

Emma motions.  Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels 
round nervously.  Emma reads his thoughts.

					EMMA
			When it happens, Steed, you'll be
			the first to know ...

With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.

189EXT.  CHURCH TOWER - DAY

As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --

A tranquil village scene.  Choirboys walk out from the church.  Nearby 
in the deserted village street.  A red PHONE BOX.  Which ...

RING-RING ... Starts to RING.

					EMMA
			Who could that be?

A ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  
Suddenly suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone.

					STEED
			No -- don't answer it ...

He pulls her back.  Emma looks at him.

					STEED
			That's it. The phones trigger
			the explosions --

RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an 
angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...

RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.  As the Choirboy nears the 
PHONE, Steed shouts --

					STEED
		Don't -- don't answer it -- !

190CLOSEUP - PHONE

RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the 
door --

191INSIDE PHONE BOX

The door shuts.  Noise muffled.  The Choirboy can't hear Steed and 
Emma's shouted warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --

192OUTSIDE

Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

					STEED
			Get down -- get down -- it's
			going to explode -- !

Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as

193INSIDE PHONE BOX

The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and

Silence.

No explosion.  A few seconds pass.  Steed and everyone
are down on the ground.  As they see --

194FROM PHONE BOX

-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.  He gets out, scans the 
crowd.  Then walks calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.

					CHOIRBOY
			It's your mother.

The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

Steed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the 
phone box, takes the call.

					STEED
			Mother? How did you find me?

His expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as 
Steed rings off. He emerges from the box.

					STEED
			I told Mother I took care of you.

					EMMA
			You lied.

					STEED
			I equivocated. But you're not
			their big worry at present. It's
			Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

OFF Emma's reaction to this news --

195INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror --

With his back turned to us.  Dr. Darling holds something in his hand, 
and waits as --

196DOWN LONG HALL

Bad ""Emma"" walks over.  She stands in front of him.

Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, 
we recognize on her neck a tattoo:  Z424.

					DR. DARLING
			We are in the final phase. I shall require 
			you to be especially obedient. There 
			must be no failures.

197CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER

which he grips tightly. As --

198IN MIRROR

a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic 
surgery and it's slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under 
kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ...

Shakes the snowshaker ...

199EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal:

Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts.

200INT.  JAG - DAY

Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.

					STEED
			Drat. Someone wants to implicate
			you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
			Any idea who?

					EMMA
			No idea who. No idea why ...

					STEED
				(thinks)
			Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
			All children's things ...

					EMMA
			... Or grown-ups, who still like
			to be children.

					STEED
			Quite. Any childhood friends?
			Enemies?

					EMMA
			Not to speak of. Peter and I
			were both loners. There was
			nobody.

Steed thinks; sighs.

					STEED
			Very well. I have a friend who
			might be of assistance. He's at
			the Ministry. We'd better be
			careful.

					EMMA
			I'm a wanted woman, I know ...

201INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY

Through a door marked ""Information & Counter Espionage"" --

-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile 
Row suit, umbrella and bowler.  Which is

Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by.

					STEED
			His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

					EMMA
			Why's he called 'Invisible'?

					STEED
			You'll find out.

At a door marked ""Information -- Col. I. Jones."" Steed knocks, opens 
the door for her.

					EMMA
			Aren't you coming?

					STEED
			I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
			he's expecting you.

Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.

202INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, 
stacks of cabinets full of old paper.

Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly 
Emma 
hears --

FOOTSTEPS.

She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get 
LOUDER.  She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of 
her --

A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own.

Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams 
shut.  Still nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a --

Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open 
up.  Then the phone lifts up by itself, a voice:

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
				(beat)
			Colonel Jones at your service,
			Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --

Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As --

A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is 
struck.  The pipe lights; smoke belches forth.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
			That usually helps. Don't worry
			about me being invisible. Other
			than that I'm perfectly normal.

					EMMA
			I see.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
			tricks in camouflage. Till this
			accident made a prang of things.
			How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?

203INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE

Steed on the phone.

					STEED
			I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
			Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
			Peel and I find ourselves in
			need of foul weather gear.
				(beat)
			Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
			for starters. And then --

204INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE

File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
			to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

					EMMA
			Peter's brother?  But --

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Half-brother to be precise.

Emma is surprised.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... 
			research into robotics and plastics.  
			Overtaken by Peter's work on the 
			physics of climate change ...

					EMMA
			I know all this.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) 
			Do you also know that during your 
			final experiment, your halfbrother-
			in-law was under surveillance?

					EMMA
			Surveillance? By whom?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Father. She gave him an 'all clear' 
			after a security test by Dr. Darling.

					EMMA
			Who's now vanished.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Makes two of us.

					EMMA
			Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling 
			and Valentine were somehow in this 
			together? But that's absurd.

Steed enters behind them on the run --

					STEED
			We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Hurry?  What for?  I'm just
			now --

					STEED
			You didn't tell her?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(testy)
			I was getting to it.

					EMMA
			Getting to what?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The World Council of Ministers meets 
			tomorrow to convene the new global 
			defense initiative --

					EMMA
			I fail to see --

					STEED
			There's a reception this evening. Colonel 
			Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

					EMMA
			Have we been invited?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(poker-voiced)
			Under the circumstances Mother didn't 
			see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

					EMMA
				(surveys her male
				outfit)
			Well, I can't possibly go like this.

					STEED
			I had a feeling. That's why we're 
			in a hurry ...

Steed proffers an arm to Emma.

					STEED
			May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?

She decides, takes his arm.

					EMMA
			You may, Mr. Steed.

The A-team is born.  Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.

205EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

Troops rushing in to take up defense positions.  Searchlights pierce 
the cloudy sky.  A protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall.

206INT.  MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT

At the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to 
Mother.  Who picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father 
and others, sitting in
passenger seats --

ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --

					MOTHER
			Inside that hall are some of the

Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --

207EXT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

Wind picking up.  Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of 
the World Council of Ministers, guards stand on duty.  Barriers, 
flashing lights.  Nobody gets past, 
except --

208INT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind 
a painting.  He with bowler and umbrella.  She in black leather and 
boots.  They find themselves in
a niche and freeze, very close to one another.  Steed sniff s ...

					STEED
			What's that you're wearing?

					EMMA
			It's called Black Leather.

					STEED
			Intoxicating. Here, have one of
			these.

He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket

					EMMA
			What is it?

					STEED
			Limpet bomb. Small, very
			compact. From Trubshaw's.

					EMMA
				(hocks it on
				belt)
			When all this is over, we simply
			must get you out of that suit.

					STEED
			You first.

					EMMA
			Shall we?

She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet 
carpets, glittering chandeliers.  From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			... In the uncertain climate that threatens 
			this global initiative, no magic umbrella 
			can shield us.

Steed checks out his own.

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			Only our own vigilance. Security and 
			stability are our watchwords.

APPLAUSE.

Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside...

					EMMA
			Trubshaw again? What now?

					STEED
			Snuff.
				(off Emma's lock)
			I must insist you try some.

Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you 
high?  They walk on, open doors to --

209INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a --

210MARBLE HALLWAY

A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess 
pieces.  Otherwise, empty.  A chamber ensemble plays ""The Merry Widow"" 
waltz, which floats through empty halls.

					STEED
			They're playing your song, Mrs.
			Peel.

					EMMA
				(annoyed)
			'The Merry Widow?' I might have
			known. Where's the reception?

They move cautiously forward as

211EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a 
light layer of white.  A Christmassy glow --

Even troops play with snowflakes, until --

212SEVERAL ANGLES

The wind rises.  The snow falls harder.

213INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They 
head down a  corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As 
--

Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of 
lobster and meats.  Steed steals --

A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma 
hides.  Steed looks up to see -- Father ""staring"" at him.

					STEED
			Oh, hello ...

					FATHER
			We want Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Dead, I'm afraid.

Emma in hiding, listens as --

					FATHER (O.S.)
			You disobeyed an order, Steed.  
			Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot 
			be trusted.

Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --

					STEED (O.S.)
			I think she can.
				(beat)
			Can you?

Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.

Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.

					FATHER
			I shall summon security.

She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.

Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --

					STEED
			Bad news. Father's looking for you.  
			Where are those bloody ministers?

					EMMA
			Have a look at this.

She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow.
Steed reacts, eyes wide.

					STEED
			It's almost May, for heaven sake.

214EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

The blizzard rages through streets --

Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow 
start to climb up shop fronts.  And amid the sky --

Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on 
unsuspecting troops --

215INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --

To Emma. But up ahead, sees --

216STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS

A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors 
as --

217INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, 
golden walls, ceiling murals --

The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or 
African robes, Chinese Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all 
distinguished men and women, surrounded by --

Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a 
web of diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --

218CENTER OF HALL

The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.

She strides into the room.  Picks a glass of champagne from a passing 
butler.  All stare, Emma raises her glass --

					EMMA
			Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach 
			of protocol. An emergency --

From the hallway -- BOOM -- !  The door bursts open, Emma is blown over 
by the blast as the purple cloud races inside.

219SEVERAL ANGLES

as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.

From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --

					STEED
			Quick --it'll protect you --

Emma inhales.  Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !  
They see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, 
wearing a gas mask, leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- 
heads like black flies -- in formation round the ministers, helpless on 
the floor.  A kidnapping --

The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

Escape from the rear doors.  The butlers form a guard to protect the 
man.

Steed and Emma run after them.  More butlers pursue.

220EXT.  PALACE - NIGHT

As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers 
load the ministers onto waiting choppers as --

221INT.  MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...

222INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --

Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.  A butler passes them without 
noticing.  They try to emerge.  But another patrols --

Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the 
ground.  He rises but Emma kicks him into as --

Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, 
protected by a posse of butlers.  He shouts --

					STEED
			After him, Mrs. Peel!

A whole posse of butlers then advances.  Steed faces them.

					STEED
			Go -- !

Emma hesitates.  Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.  
She bangs the button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from 
MACHINE-GUNNING gas-masked butlers strike the brass door as --

Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.  
To give Emma time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, 
brute force to --

Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --

223EXT.  ELEVATOR (UPPER FLOORS) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma.  They head 
upstairs, pressing elevator ""CALL"" buttons on every floor, as --

224INSIDE ELEVATOR

Emma waits inside.  Until she reaches --

225EXT.  ELEVATOR (2ND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Doors open.  A HAIL of BULLETS hit the lift as Emma hides to one side 
until the doors close.

226INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Emma sighs with relief.  COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.

227ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE

Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --

228INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

At the next floor, the doors open --

Two butlers rush inside.  BLAM -- !  Emma cuts one in the throat with 
an elbow punch, then --

Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who 
recovers enough to grab Emma by the throat.

She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson 
hold on his arms and throat --

And a knee in his back in time for --

PING!  The BELL RINGS at --

3rd floor where --

Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --

Whooomph!  a blast of fire from --

A flamethrower launched in the hall.

Aaargh -- !  The butler gets fried, but --

229EXT.  ELEVATOR (3RD FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Shields Emma from the worst of the blast. She  hurls him clear of the 
doors, which --

230INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION

Slam shut.  COOL HUM ...

231EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering 
madly, trying to get upstairs to help Emma...

232INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap 
doors.  No secret panels.  The ""floor"" light flickers between floors.

Waiting, until ...

233EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one 
corner, Emma dives to the other side, then --

Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  
Scrambles more.  It slips out ...

Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a 
foot, kicks the grenade towards the butlers, and --

As her elevator doors close --

BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom --

Rushes to --

234ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The 
light PINGS. Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when --

235BUTLER'S POV

No Emma.

236BACK TO SCENE

The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what 
to do, and --

The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in -
-

237INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we --

PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the 
elevator roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --

Emma, who -- drops down and --

Scissors the butler's head between her legs.

The grenade rolls free ...

Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --

Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from 
the guy, until --

Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags --

238EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps 
out, heads up for the stairs, the elevators doors.

SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which

239INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Breaks from its ropes, and --

Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --

240INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his 
way up, step by step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as 
he struggles...

241INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT

Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --

Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, 
and locks the skylight.  As the grenade --

242INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE

BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  
Emma rushes thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to 
open it -- locked.

A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the 
switch, flips the skylight up, and --

Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her.

243EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT

Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a 
super-fab streamlined whirly chopper ...

Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the 
city.  Stands up before her --

Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees 
assassin in balls. Flicks him backwards ...

As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes 
forward.  
But too late:  sees --

The chopper -- about to take off.

244FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

The gas-masked MAN in the white lab coat:

					MAN
			Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!

245EXT.  ROOFTOP

The chopper rises slowly.

Emma looks.  A fifteen foot leap ... Impossible.

246FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

A farewell wave from the gas-masked man.

247CLOSEUP - EMMA

contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance 
grows.

248EMMA'S POV

The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly.

249INT.  CHOPPER - NIGHT

Above London rooftops, after dark --

The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler 
(ditto).  From the chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command 
module.  A fairy tale, snow white city.

OVER the RADIO, interference.  A changing of stations.  Then a CRACKLY 
broadcast of ""The Merry Widow.""

As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city  -- 
a KNOCKING from outside on the door --

Surprised reactions.  The Butler opens the door, sees --

Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.  The Butler is too dumbstruck 
to say anything.

					EMMA
				(shouts, re:  the
				gas mask)
			Anyone ever tell you you look
			like a housefly?

Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --

The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.  Emma watches him 
fall ...

					EMMA
			Anyone else need a lift?

The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, 
still clinging ...

					MAN
				(to Pilot; intercom)
			Can't you throw her off?

The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --

Blam -- !  a kinky leather boot crashes --

Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the 
chopper, SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air -
-

The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(intercom)
			Where'd she go?

250EXT.  CHOPPER TOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the 
top of the chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's 
lights twinkle beneath ...

As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit --

Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air --

The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.  Grabs Emma.  Slithers back onto 
the cockpit. Pistol whips her.  Emma crunches back onto the metal.  
Blades whirring close!  
The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --

					CO-PILOT
			Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.

He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where 
his head getssliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away 
separately ...

As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated 
Man pulls her down the side of the chopper --

Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire 
below the chopper.  As --

251EXT.  WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings.  Trying 
to dislodge Emma ...

252THEIR POV

Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up 
topped in snow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...

""THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ,"" no longer heard as old record or ensemble 
arrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...

253CLOSEUP - EMMA

grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming 
up to the cockpit from behind --

254BACK TO SCENE

With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes 
flying towards eternity on his own.

The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it 
himself ...

255IN NIGHT AIR

""THE MERRY WIDOW"" BOOMS, the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and 
down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz ...

256INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

The white-coated Man gets control ...

257EXT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of 
windows.

258SEVERAL ANGLES

as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ...

259EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ...

Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going 
on ... rockets and lights in the sky thru snowflakes ...

Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and --

260CLOSEUP SHOT

Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit.

261HER POV

The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the 
bridge!

262INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

The Man sees the bomb ...

Also flings himself onto the bridge as --

Against b.g. of the fireworks display --

263WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in 
appreciation ... great fireworks!

264EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for 
him.

He runs too -- towards --

265ANOTHER CHOPPER

which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... 
The Man reaches for the dangling ladder --
but --

266CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT

stuck, wedged between narrow battlements.

267BACK TO SCENE

The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope 
ladder.  He pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, 
sailing off in the second chopper,
leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, 
bending over, when she sees --

268CLOSEUP - SHOE

Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  ""Trubshaw's of 
Jermyn Street.""

					STEED (V.O.)
			I thought it was Cinderella
			who lost her slipper ...

269INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN

On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  
PA announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal 
a fire glows, a CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, 
surrounded by a pile of shoes.  Steed & Trubshaw beside her.

					EMMA
			This time the shoe's on the other
			foot. You said a hand-made shoe
			was as good as a photo-fit or
			D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
			find the shoe that fits ...

					TRUBSHAW
			It should be easy. A Trubshaw
			client has his shoes delivered
			personally. The Ministry should
			be able to confirm our delivery.

					STEED
			I'll be back ...

					EMMA
			Where are you going?

					STEED
			Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather 
			may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

					EMMA
			You needn't bother. I can't drag you 
			further into this. After all, I am still 
			the chief suspect.

					STEED
			No bother. Mother and Father think
			I've joined you. I might as well.

					EMMA
			But --

					STEED
				(comes back)
			Oh, and by the way, I think it's about 
			time you got rid of that chip on your 
			shoulder.

					EMMA
			If you'd been through what I have,
			you wouldn't --

Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.

					STEED
			A microtag. One of Mother's little
			toys. There you are. Free at last.

He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.

270INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like 
ceremonial swords -- ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...

Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...

271UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER

Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a 
pair of shoe lasts.

					EMMA
			Prince Charming, I presume.
			Your name is ...

272CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL

with the name:  DARLING.

					EMMA
			Oh my God ...

Steed selects his umbrella and we FOLLOW UP TO:

274INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - UPSTAIRS - DAY

He sees only Trubshaw.

					STEED
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					TRUBSHAW
			She just left, sir. In a hurry.

					STEED
			What?

					TRUBSHAW
			She said you'd understand.

275ON STEED

Worried.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are ...

276CLOSEUP - PIP PUFFING IN MID-AIR

WIDEN to reveal:

277INT.  MINISTRY ARCHIVES - DAY

Inside the archives, among leather volumes.  A file goes through the 
air, passed to Emma ... As she reads.  A map is opened across a desk 
from her.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			'X' marks the spot. The shoes were 
			delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
			Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the 
			site of a former Ministry installation...

					EMMA
			... and now?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Privately owned by ...

					EMMA
			Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			I shall need a small plane.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			You're not venturing alone, surely.

					EMMA
			I'm going to find out who killed
			my husband. Will you take these
			documents to Steed?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Of course.

278ON EMMA

					EMMA
			Tell him I said ... goodbye.

279INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY

below the Thames as at the beginning.

In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.  
Controls around him flash emergency.  Panic.  Cakes piled up beside 
him, uneaten.  Beside him, Father. Brenda hands a phone.

					BRENDA
			Steed for you.

Mother grabs the phone, furious.

					MOTHER
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, 
Father just sits there.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I was hoping you could tell me.

					MOTHER
			You're getting yourself into terrible 
			trouble, my son. Weather's turning 
			very nasty -- and so am I.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I'm going to follow up on a hunch of 
			my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is 
			innocent and you have a mole.

					MOTHER
				(grabs mirror;
				searches his face)
			Where?

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			In your operation.

					MOTHER
			I'm warning you for the last time, 
			Steed: whoever's behind all this, 
			looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like 
			Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

CLICK.  The line goes dead.

280CLOSE ON MOTHER

Furious.

					MOTHER
			Steed??
				(to Father)
			Find Mrs. Peel.

Brenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.

281EXT.  SKY - DAY

Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma 
leaps in parachute ...  Down, down, down through the mist ...

Over parkland, the parachute floats down ... To an island in the middle 
of the Serpentine river.

282EXT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - DAY

Emma lands, buries her parachute.  Walks towards a thick jungle, then a 
stream.  Emma hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again.  
Where a peacock fans its tail of a thousand eyes.  A CLICK of CAMERAS.

In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees --

283HER POV

A red phone box.  Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside.  Picks up 
the phone. Presses ""Button B"", and --

The floor goes down.  Emma goes down with it, into --

284INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND HQ

Formerly a Ministry installation.  The ""elevator"" stops.  Remembering, 
as from a dream, Emma steps out into --

285LONG DARK CORRIDOR

A GUARD patrols.  Emma pushes herself against a wall.  The wall gives 
way to flip round, and Emma swivels into --

286INT.  TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER

The door locks behind.  Alone, Emma stands warily.

From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.  Intimate.  Seductive.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have 
			been a worthy opponent. You have 
			tracked us down. You are within an 
			ace of winning.

					EMMA
			This isn't a game.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Quite right, but we still make the rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			People, too.

					EMMA
			Then who wins?

					VOICE
			You and I. Together. But first you 
			must confront your greatest enemy.
			Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?  
			The answer is obvious ...

Suddenly lights!

Emma is in a hall of mirrors.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Yourself.

In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare 
back at her, splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and 
confused by the multiple images.

Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and 
kisses her on the lips.

Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls 
her mouth away, staggers back; realizes too late.  The hallucinogenic 
lip poison.  Emma crumples
to her knees as --

287EMMA'S POV

Sees ""herself"" above her, before she -- falls unconscious.

Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather.

--

										DISSOLVE 
TO:

290INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q.

As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:  A life 
size snow shaker. Emma ""swims"" in viscous air,suspended like a mermaid.  
Thru glass she sees --

A face peering in:  Father.

					FATHER
				(filtered)
			Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
			Mrs. Peel.
				(filtered)
			We've been expecting you. We hope 
			you'll enjoy your stay with us. 
			Decontamination is almost complete.

					EMMA
			Decontamination -- ?

					FATHER
			And you've a new wardrobe. He
			does want you to look attractive.
				(beat )
			He tells me you're very beautiful.

Emma pounds the glass in frustration.

					FATHER
			Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
			of feet below ground. The Ministry
			made it impregnable. No one can
			save you.

291EXT.  SPIRES OF ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

as Steed drives towards it ...

292INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM

Bathed in candlelight.  A romantic supper for two ...

A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.  
She locks around, sees another door.  In search of escape she hastens 
to open it, only to reveal --

A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.

Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, 
removing the 
head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!

					DR. DARLING
			Emma, my dear. How lovely you
			look.

He steps out of the rest of his costume ...

					EMMA
			Would that I could say the Same.

					DR. DARLING
			Ah, but you haven't see the real
			me. Watch closely ...

He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards 
her --

Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --

Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!

					EMMA
			Peter ...

					PETER
			Darling Emma --

					EMMA
			It was you ... all the time?

					PETER
			Not really. Not quite. I'm
			afraid you still don't see ...

Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...

Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.

It's Valentine!

					TEACHER (V.O.)
			Valentine Peel ...

293EXT.  ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails.

					OLD TEACHER (V.O.)
			Yes, I remember him quite well ...

PULL BACK THROUGH windows to reveal:  Steed and an OLD TEACHER in the

					OLD TEACHER
			This is where he used to spend his

He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed --

He walks around the dinner table as he talks ...

298FLASHBACK - CLOSE ON HAND IN WHITE GLOVE

Twisting the dial.  PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.

					VALENTINE (V.O.)
			Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.

299BACK TO PRESENT

			Fortunately my research into plastics 
			came in handy ...

					EMMA
				(stunned)
			Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

					VALENTINE
			An unholy trinity ...

					EMMA
				(stands)
			You killed my husband.

					VALENTINE
			For starters. Of course I had to kill 
			the Teddy Bears, as well ...

					EMMA
			Too many cooks --

					VALENTINE
			Spoil the majority shareholders. In 
			Wonderland Weather. I planned 
			everything, even the Ministry 
			recruiting you ...

					EMMA
			But I found you. All the clues
			led me here ...

					VALENTINE
			Of course. I planned that, too.

					EMMA
			But -- why?

					VALENTINE
			You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't
			you guess?
				(moves toward her)
			For you. It was all for you ...

					EMMA
				(cold)
			'Our revels now are ended.'

					VALENTINE
			Oh, no, Emma. They've only
			just begun ...

300INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE - NIGHT

The phone hangs in the air -- with the smoking pipe.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The shoes were delivered to an island 
			in the Serpentine - former Ministry 
			installation ... she said to tell you 
goodbye. What?

301CLOSEUP - STEED IN RED PHONEBOX (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT

					STEED
			I said it's not goodbye yet.
			Listen, I'm going to need some
			help. In a hurry ...

302INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND - DINING ROOM

					VALENTINE
				(indicates supper)
			Think of this as your second
			wedding feast ...

					EMMA
			I'm already married ...

					VALENTINE
			Come, come, you're a widow -- a
			most attractive widow. Now I think 
			of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

He pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably 
hostile.

					VALENTINE
			My latest model. A compound of 
			plastics and sensor chips. A big 
			improvement on the old X404s.
			The poor thing is quite fond of me. 
			Emma, say hello to Emma.

BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.

					VALENTINE 
			You know, I believe she's actually 
			jealous.

					EMMA
			Valentine, listen to me ...

					VALENTINE
			Right, bridesmaid. Now what
			have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
			the ring.

					EMMA
				(covers her hand)
			Ring?

He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then:

					VALENTINE
			How silly of me -- let me make
			you comfortable first ...

As he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye

										DISSOLVE 
TO:

303INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT

Another ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high 
plastic ball emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, 
a zip peels away the plastic layer to reveal --

Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  
He steps out, and, poking with his umbrella --

Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA 
EYES the peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where 
he sees the --

304RED PHONEBOX

Steed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits 
""Button B.""  As the floor lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ...

305SARCOPHAGUS

carved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into 
--

306INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it.

Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within.

					VALENTINE
			That's better. I say, isn't this 
			where you came in? It's
			impenetrable, by the way ...

					EMMA
			You're mad.

					VALENTINE
			Entirely. On the other hand
				(he advances towards
				her, smiling)
			Mad people get things done. Let
			me show you --

307INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed stealing down a corridor and --

hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock 
cameras.  He waits till they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and -
-

Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings 
her down.

					FATHER
			Steed

					STEED
			How did you guess?

					FATHER
			You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black
			Leather ...

					STEED
			It was you who gave Valentine
			Peel his security clearance ...
			you're the mole who betrayed
			the Ministry.

					FATHER
			Mother betrayed me. She was 
			going to replace me with a younger 
			Father.  Errand boy that's all I was.  
			'Find Steed...'

					STEED
			Well, you found me. Have a sniff of 
			this, why don't you? Careful, the 
			scent can be overpowering ...

Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose 
boutonniere, squeezes the rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes 
out.  Steed rises, locks around.
Sees --

A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards 
return.  He turns 
and --

308INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing --
until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.

Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --

309INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER

Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV 
monitors as Valentine explains.

					VALENTINE
			People expect weather to be free. 
			They're used to it. I call that a 
			denial of freedom. No freedom of 
			choice. An abuse of human rights. 
			They buy water, electricity, gas. 
			Why shouldn't they be able to buy 
			their own weather if they want to? 
			If they have a little incentive ...

Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.

					EMMA
			Such as?

					VALENTINE
			Destruction of their local weather 
			systems. I can zap a thousand 
			Chernobyls into the air.

					EMMA
			The result would be ...

					VALENTINE
			Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop 
			failure.  Economic disaster.  
			Frostbite or sunburn ... on a 
			massive scale. 
			You've seen a few samples...

					EMMA
			Then what's stopping you?

					VALENTINE
			One very small thing. A diamond
			'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
			more information on a fraction of
			the size. If I possess that, my
			powers would be unlimited. My
			dear half-brother was developing
			it. But he suspected sabotage.
			He gave the chip to ... you,
			'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
			also your ring.

Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --

310CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex 
fractal equation of circuits.

311BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			The missing piece of the jigsaw.
			I tried to get you to give it to me 
			as Peter; I tried to steal it from 
			you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll 
			be a bit less subtle.
				(he slips it off her
				finger; holds it up)
			With this ring my plan will be
			complete.

					EMMA
			How Wagnerian ... Do you mean 
			to say you've waited all these 
			years because you couldn't create 
			a chip on your own? That would 
			have amused Peter.

					VALENTINE
			Speaking of Peter, there's more good 
			news: You won't even have to change 
			your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			What are my choices?

					VALENTINE
			Choices?

					EMMA
			I'll never marry you.

Valentine is philosophical.  He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying 
it flat -- Emma 
lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --

					VALENTINE
			One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you 
			alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, 
			you may change your mind. If you're 
			still in it.

Valentine presses a button.  From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.  
Moves down to within inches of her face.

					VALENTINE
			This little toy gave me back my face.
			It can replace yours. What do you think?
			Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
			Thatcher?

He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.

An ALARM BELL RINGS.  Emma reacts.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
			have an intruder. I repeat --

Valentine switches off the PA.

					VALENTINE
			Ah. That will be Steed. He followed 
			you. Please excuse me. I have work 
			to do. My most spectacular 
			performance. A ballet of clouds. It 
			was made for you. I want to give you 
			a heart, Emma. I want all of London 
			to see it. And now with this ...
				(flourishes ring)
			They will.
				(leans close)
			And for an encore: the biggest cyclone 
			in history will wipe the City from the 
			face of the earth.
				(winks)
			Shape of things to come, my darling.

He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled 
protests.  Darkness.

Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.  No such 
luck.

					STEED
			Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!

He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she 
could hear him in that thing, anyway.

He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.

312EXT.  SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT

Moonlight night.  Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.

313INSIDE CLOUDS

MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...

In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- 
over the city -- a strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half 
dreamlike.

That stalks the city....

314INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed crawling.  A rat runs over him ...

					STEED
			The things I do for England ...

Pitch dark, then --

Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.

Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at 
her to undo the gag.  Bad Emma removes it, she --

Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- 
warm human flesh. Blood.  Her flesh.  Her blood.  Fascinated.

					EMMA
			You must let me go ...

Bad Emma listens.  Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
the HEARTBEAT.  Ba-boom.  Ba-boom ...

					EMMA
			Don't you understand? If he has
			me, he'll have no use for you ...
			he'll destroy you ...

The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.  She goes to the 
laser, aims it at Emma's face!

					EMMA
			No...

Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --

315ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.

The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for 
him --

					STEED
			Oh, dear.

No escape.  He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its 
brim, aims it at the guards, and --

Hurls it ...

316CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)

A glinting razor's edge, which --

Swoosh -- !  Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a 
boomerang to Steed. He taps twice hard steel as ...

317OTHER GUARDS

run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in 
their faces, a sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -
- !  The other collapses, slump to the ground.  Steed stoops down, 
picks up his hat, sees --

A dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  
Genuine rage.

					STEED
			Someone's going to pay for this.

Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --

318CLOSEUP - VALENTINE

places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking 
diamond chips ...

WIDEN to reveal ...

319INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of 
rapiers ... )

Valentine hits a switch ...

					VALENTINE
			Start the countdown. Action
			stations. Five minutes ...

The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --

Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS.

Father enters behind him.

					FATHER
			Congratulations. The clouds are
			on course ...

					VALENTINE
			To explode. London will be ashes.

					FATHER
			Not yet! They haven't heard our
			terms ... !

Father tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.

					VALENTINE
			Are you insane? Stop the program
			and you activate the auto-destruct!

					FATHER
			But all those people -- !

Valentine strikes her hard --

					VALENTINE
			My cloud ballet! My cyclone!

Father slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on 
the control panel red lights, as --

320EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT

Up in the sky, more white clouds --

Darken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases 
and energy.Swirling with motion, a life of their own.

FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, 
slowly forming as it rolls --

321THROUGH CITY STREETS

then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
A love heart.

322CLOSEUP - DIGITAL READOUTS

Whirling backwards ...

323INT.  MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Mother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS 
BLARE.  WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --

					MOTHER
			Dense cloud formation moving south-

			The prediction is ... unstable chemical

			Emergency stand by ... !

324EXT.  SKY OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

Bad storm clouds advance over London ... black and furious.

325OVER CITY - SEVERAL ANGLES

As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.  An airborne CYCLONE of 
BELCHING static ELECTRICITY.  The black shape now --

Forming a sensuous female shape.  Like a dream wisp of ...

Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.  While --

326FROM RIVER

The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -
- trying to connect, to form the cyclone ...

327EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

Action stations.  AIR RAID SIRENS ...

Like a re-run Blitz.  Streets now eerily empty and dark.
Through deserted streets --

Troops race to positions in gas masks.  Searchlights illuminate clouds.  
Worried faces watch the skies, as --

328CLOSEUP - DIGITAL NUMBERS

Fly ...

329INT.  HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY

Chaos on all TV monitors as ...

Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.  What 
will he find?? Emma's there, still gagged.  Looks asleep.

					VALENTINE
			My dear.
				(pulls the gag:
				kisses her)
			I wouldn't want you to miss the
			grand finale ...

Emma opens her eyes.  Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale 
sign:  Z424. 
Bad Emma is unmistakable.  He strikes her -- yanks her out of the 
coffin.

					VALENTINE
			Find her. Kill her ...

He races back upstairs as ...

330INT.  UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the 
place, crawling high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She 
hears NOISE IN the
DISTANCE.  Suddenly --

331INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose.

Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all 
oncomers, closing in on --

332INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door.

He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying 
to figure out how to stop the program.

Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a 
contact lens in water.

333FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH

opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  
Steed whirls.

					VALENTINE
			John Steed.

					STEED
			Valentine Peel. I see you've gone 
			back to using your original face.

					VALENTINE
			The last one you'll ever see.

					STEED
			Perish the thought.

Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.

					VALENTINE
			Did they tell you at Eton that I
			was fencing champion, too?

Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.

					STEED
			They said you were a very naughty 
			boy.

The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!

334SEVERAL ANGLES

					VALENTINE
			You're better than I expected.

					STEED
			I was at Harrow ...

					VALENTINE
			But did they teach you this?

Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A 
diminished phallic symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

Valentine advances towards Steed --

Who points the umbrella at him.

					STEED
			Bang-bang ... you're dead.

					VALENTINE
			You wish.

He moves to close in, when ...

335CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT

from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --

336VALENTINE

recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  
Steed blows smoke away from the muzzle.

					STEED
			One shot -- for emergencies.

					VALENTINE
				(clutches wound)
			That's not playing by the rules.

					STEED
				(echoes Emma!)
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VALENTINE
				(pulls his own gun)
			If you say so.

					STEED
			I do.

He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

					VALENTINE
			You said ... one shot.

					STEED
			Did I? My mistake.

Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the 
countdown, when behind the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  
Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

					VALENTINE
			I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

Steed turns.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel -- !

Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

					VALENTINE
			Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the 
			thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. 
			We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
				(to Steed)
			We wouldn't want to miss the
			fireworks. Figure it out if you can, 
			Steed ...

337DOWN HATCH

Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.

338ON STEED

He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed 
goes to the control module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...

339EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the 
city, gathering momentum ...

340NUMBERS

going down, down, down, as ...

345EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

The giant cyclone begins to break apart ...

346SEVERAL ANGLES - DYING STORM

347CLOSEUP - RELIEVED FACES

Troops pulling off gas masks as ...

348INT.  CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...

Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM 
reconfigures. A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 

""AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES""

start flashing ...

A different set of numbers start running backwards ...

					STEED
			You must be joking ...

349EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

					VALENTINE
			Fool ...

In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma 
takes a bad fall down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

					STEED
			That will do.

He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his 
revolver.

					VALENTINE
			Aren't you forgetting about
			something?

					STEED
			You are, and it's behind you.

					VALENTINE
			Come, come. You don't really
			expect me to fall for --

Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

					VALENTINE
			Let go, you ... idiot ...

Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

					STEED
			I think she really likes you ...
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					VALENTINE
			Ugh ...

As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled 
together, she chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, 
Valentine locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

They fall into the mists and liquid below.

Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, 
sees ...

350EMMA

Dead.

					STEED
			Emma!

He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.

Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like ""Sleeping Beauty.""  His 
eyes fill with tears.  He lays her down.

					STEED
			Emma ...

He produces Peter's ring.

351CLOSEUP - RING

Slips it onto her finger and ...

352BACK TO SCENE

Kisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion 
of a lover.  He closes his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL 
SOUNDS but Steed doesn't give a damn.

Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  
Looks up at him.

					EMMA
			Steed?

Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			What kept you?

					STEED
			The plot.
				(realizing)
			Hello, we must be going ...

353CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS

Racing backwards as ...

354SEVERAL ANGLES

Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's 
Labyrinth ...

355MORE NUMBERS

racing to zero, nothing to stop them ...

356INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.

					EMMA
			Quick!

Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid 
as ...

357SEVERAL ANGLES

3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ 
is fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's "" coffin"" goes flying ... as the 
SCREEN WHITES OUT.

358EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT

		Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.

359BELOW

it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ...

Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.

					STEED
			'The owl and the pussycat went
			to sea -'

					EMMA
			'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

					STEED
			A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Still a bit chilly ...

					STEED
			English weather. You know, after 
			all we've been through, I should 
			say we deserve a long holiday ...

					EMMA
			Have you any place in mind?

					STEED
			As a matter of fact I have ...

The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.

									SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

360EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY                                 360

A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled 
behind them, WHIP CRACKED by a --

Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble 
from ice and snow into --

361SAND

The peasant stops, stares.

362AHEAD OF HIM

Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  
POPS a CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the 
beach to

363TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma 
in a bikini.

					EMMA
			I don't recall Siberia being this
			warm, Steed.

					STEED
			It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Our little paradise -- just made
			for two?

					STEED
				(looks; frowns)
			Not quite.

On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair 
contraption -- with Brenda.  He waves to --

					STEED
			Our chaperon.

					EMMA
			Pity your mother came, too ...

Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  
Trubshaw pours glasses of champagne.

					STEED
			Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
			Is this the '28? A little more
			ice, I think ...

Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother 
moves in.  Absorbed by Emma, now his new protegee.

					MOTHER
			About your next assignment, Mrs.
			Peel ...

					EMMA
			Next assignment?

Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch 
-- an umbrella shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical 
weather.  Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a 
giant glass bubble, hearing --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
			nearby?

					STEED (V.O.)
			Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
			send Mother ...

PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.

					MOTHER (V.O.)
			Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
			another macaroon ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Thank you, Steed.

					STEED (V.O.)
			Thank you, Mrs. Peel.

Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.  CHINK of GLASSES.

										FADE OUT.

EXT. TENEMENT - LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING

The tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out,
but a home, a shelter nonetheless.

INT. TENEMENT - MORNING

People to our surprise live in here.  It is a commune.  The
homeless, people who have been left out, forgot about,
written off, and don't matter.  The fringes of society.

CHEEBA, a skinny Puerto Rican male, tries to wake a
slumbering body under a mass of old newspapers.

										3.


				CHEEBA
			Yo, let's get to it.  You don't
			dance, we don't eat.  Simple as that.

The mass begins to move.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			That's right.  We slow.  We blow.
			We snooze.  We lose.

INT. CNS TOWER - MORNING

MANRAY, a young African-American dread-lock male, and Cheeba
are getting set up in front of the entrance to the
CONTINENTAL NETWORK SYSTEM building.  CNS is one of the
fledgling, upstart new networks, trying to battle with ABC,
NBC, CBS, FOX, WB, and UPN.

ANGLE ON

Entrance.  Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the
sidewalk.  Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off
and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles
of the shoes instead of real taps.

				CHEEBA
			Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
			I know everybody is in a hurry to
			work, ready to begin another day in
			this rat race.  But don't sleep us.
			I'm Cheeba and I introduce to you
			the world renown MANRAY, the man
			with the educated feet.

Manray takes a small bow.  A few, not many, people have
stopped to look.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			As we continue our world wind tour,
			we would like to give you a little
			somethin', somethin' before you go
			off to make that money.  I give you
			Manray.

CLOSE ON

Manray, who starts to do his thing, and when he starts doing
his thing attention must be paid.

ANGLE ON

Crowd, as Manray gets busy, people gather to watch.

ANGLE ON

Delacroix, he is about to walk into the CNS building but
stops to check out Manray.

CLOSE ON

Manray, he pounds out some intricate steps and freezes at
the end of the move.

ANGLE ON

Crowd, who applaud as Cheeba unfolds a brown shopping bag
and holds it out in front of them.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			Thank you very much but please
			don't go without giving us some
			cheddar, cheese, money.  We prefer
			two's than fews.

People are digging into their pockets.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			I would like to add that both of us
			are homeless.  Not that it means
			anything.

A WOMAN is about to dump some change in the brown paper bag.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			I said homeless.  Ladies and
			gentlemen.  Senorita, do you know
			what that means?

Cheeba looks at her and she quickly pulls out a 5-spot from
her purse and drops it into the bag.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			Muchos gracias.

Cheeba works his way over to Delacroix.

				DELACROIX
			Good morning, Cheeba.

				CHEEBA
			Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.

				DELACROIX
			De-la-croix.

				CHEEBA
			Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet
			for Manray and I yet?

										5.


				DELACROIX
			Not yet.

Delacroix hands Cheeba a ten dollar bill.

				CHEEBA
			Gracias.

Delacroix moves towards the revolving doors of CNS.

				DELACROIX
			Manray, Sloan says you're too
			talented to be dancing on the street.

				MANRAY
			Well do something about it.

INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

Delacroix is the lone person of color in the elevator.

INT. CNS - MORNING

Delacroix gets off the elevator, takes out his ID, slips it
through the scanner and enters the reception area of CNS.

				DELACROIX
			Good morning, Marie.

				MARIE
			It's not gonna be a good morning
			for you if you don't get into
			Dunwitty's staff meeting.

				DELACROIX
			What staff meeting?

				MARIE
			The staff meeting that started 30
			minutes ago.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff
meeting that is already in progress.  TWENTY WRITERS sit
around an oval table, all are Caucasian except Delacroix,
again he's the lone person of color, the ""fly in the
buttermilk.""

DUNWITTY, Senior V.P. of the Entertainment Division of CNS
looks at Delacroix and waits for him to sit down before he
continues.

										6.


				DUNWITTY
			Monsieur Delacroix, this very
			important meeting commenced...

Dunwitty looks at his Rolex Chronograph - Daytona Model.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.

				DUNWITTY
			I'm sorry I'm late.

				DUNWITTY
			Do you know how much information
			can be dispensed in one minute alone?

				DELACROIX
			I didn't find out about this very
			important staff meeting until...

Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Four minutes ago.

				DUNWITTY
			So are you telling me everyone knew
			about this get-together except you?

				DELACROIX
			I wasn't told about this until
			Marie informed me as soon as I got
			off the elevator.

All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.

				DUNWITTY
			People, you can attempt to pull a
			Rodman like our friend Delacroix,
			but I guarantee you'll be sent
			packing just like him.

Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an
overhead projector.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			These are the standings.  Read 'em
			and weep.  As you can plainly see
			the Continental Network System is
			languishing.

CLOSE ON

Ratings charts.

				DUNWITTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			Look at 'em people.  We are BOOTY,
			CA CA.  We are DOO-DOO.  Doo-doo on
			a stick, if you will.

CLOSE ON

Dunwitty.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			I do not like to be the laughing
			stock of the broadcast industry.  I
			have pride and people, you better
			start getting some too.  These
			numbers have to go up.

Dunwitty turns on the lights.  JOAN, one of the writers,
raises her hand.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			Question?

				JOAN
			So what do you want us to do?

				DUNWITTY
			What I want everyone to do is write
			some material that is FUNNY.  The
			junk you've been writing is about
			as funny as a dead baby.  It's not
			funny, it's not new.  It's not sexy.
			It, it, it...

CLOSE ON

Fish.

				FISH
			Sucks.

ANGLE ON

Conference room.

				DUNWITTY
			SUCKS.  Thank you, Fish.  This
			meeting is over but I want everyone
			to seriously think about what I
			said and how you can deliver.

People scurry out.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now.

										8.


INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

The writers, beat down, come out of the conference room and
move past SLOAN HOPKINS, a highly attractive African-
American ""sistuh.""

Delacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk.  He
talks under his breath.

				SLOAN
			How was it?

				DELACROIX
			Why didn't you tell me about this
			staff meeting?

				SLOAN
			Nobody told me anything.

				DELACROIX
			What good are you if you don't tell
			me stuff like this?

				SLOAN
			It wasn't my fault.  If I would
			have known, I would have known.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action
photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on
his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.

ANGLE ON

Office.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows
overlooking mid-town Manhattan.

				DUNWITTY
			Do you know what C.P. Time is?

				DELACROIX
			C.P. Time is Colored People's Time.
			The stereotypical belief that
			Negroes are always late.  That
			Negroes have no sense of time -
			time except when it comes to music
			or dance.

They both laugh.

				DUNWITTY
			Let's sit down over there.

										9.


Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			I'm sorry about my blowup but I
			have to have a whipping boy every
			meeting.

				DELACROIX
			I understand.  But again, in all
			honesty I was not informed.

				DUNWITTY
			Forget it.  I believe you're my
			most creative person I've got on
			staff.  You're hip.  You know
			what's happening.  I got some corny
			white boys and girls writing for me.

Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he
doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is
headed with it.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			I understand Black culture.  I grew
			up around black people all my life.
			If the truth be told I probably
			know ""niggers"" better than you,
			Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't
			get offended by my use of the
			quote-unquote N word.  I got a
			black wife and three bi-racial
			children, so I feel I have a right
			to use that word.  I don't give a
			damn what Spike says, Tarantino is
			right.  Nigger is just a word.  If
			Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every
			other word so can I.

				DELACROIX
			I would prefer you not use that
			word in my presence.

				DUNWITTY
			NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.

Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse
and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.

				DELACROIX
			Say it again.  C'mon, say it again.

CLOSE ON

Dunwitty.  He's a bloody pulp.

										  10.


CLOSE ON

Delacroix.

He straightens his tie.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Who's a nigger now?

POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO
REALITY.  Everything's how we left it.

				DUNWITTY
			The material you've been creating
			is too white bread.  White people
			with black faces.  The Huxtable's,
			Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's
			dead.  We can't go down that road
			again.

				DELACROIX
			I don't agree.  The Negro middle
			class does exist, and it's rich
			material for a dramatic series or
			sitcom.

				DUNWITTY
			I'm telling you it's not.

He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts
throwing them one by one against the window.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			The middle class black family moves
			into a white suburban enclave.  The
			middle class black family moves
			into a small Southern town that is
			run by the KKK.  The middle class
			single black father raises his
			teenage daughter.  The middle class
			single black father raises his
			teenage daughter.  The middle class
			single black mother raises her
			teenage son.  And so on and so
			forth.  It's too clean, too
			antiseptic...

				DELACROIX
			...to white?  I still feel all of
			my scripts would make good shows.

										  11.


				DUNWITTY
			Delacroix, wake up, brother man.
			The reason why they didn't get
			picked up was because nobody - and
			I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers
			alike wants to see that junk.

				DELACROIX
			I've never been given a fair shot.

				DUNWITTY
			You got your head stuck up your ass
			with your Harvard education and
			your pretentious ways.  Brother
			man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm
			keepin' it real and you're frontin',
			trying to be white.

				DELACROIX
			I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I
			don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM
			OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF
			DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as
			you might put it, some ""nigger""
			show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than
			white and you're blacker than black?
			Is that what you think?

				DUNWITTY
			That's exactly what I think.  I
			want you to create something that
			people want to see.  Let's be
			honest, the majority of the people
			in the country are deaf, dumb and
			blind and I'm including 35 million
			African-Americans.  You know and I
			know ""niggers"" set the trend, set
			the styles.  This is a golden
			opportunity now.  These idiots have
			to be led to the water.

				DELACROIX
			I'm not sure if I can deliver what
			you want.

				DUNWITTY
			You will or you'll be back at BET
			so quick you'll never know what hit
			you.  I need a mid-season
			replacement and pronto.  It will be
			on the fast track.

										  12.


				DELACROIX
			What is it you want from me?  Some
			plantation follies?  Some sitcom
			that takes place on a watermelon
			patch?  Some show that follows four
			nigger generations of junkies and
			crackheads?  You want me to go back
			to the ante bellum days?

				DUNWITTY
			Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show
			that will make headlines, that will
			have millions and millions of
			households tuned in, glued to their
			televisions every week.  I want
			advertisers dying to buy on this
			show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show
			out of you if it kills you.

EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT

WE SEE a street lamp, and coming out of it are some wires.
WE FOLLOW the wires into a tenement building.

The residents have tapped into a street light courtesy of
CON EDISON for power.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Cheeba stands in front of the makeshift kitchen, which
includes a hot plate, and prepares a gourmet meal of a tasty
Spanish dish.  The clean apartment is furnished with stuff
people have thrown out that they picked up on the street.

				MANRAY
			I'm starvin' like Marvin.

				CHEEBA
			My world famous, famous world Arroz
			con pollo will be ready very soon.

				MANRAY
			Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.

				CHEEBA
			Did we get our bill yet?

They both laugh.

				MANRAY
			I guess that will come with the
			rent, gas, and Con Ed bills, too.

										  13.


				CHEEBA
			Ahh, the luxuries of life.

				MANRAY
			Yo, check it.  This is good and all
			that but one day soon I want to
			have much Benjamins so I can have a
			nice crib and pay all my bills.
			You hear me.

				CHEEBA
			Chill, I'm the brains behind this
			outfit.

				MANRAY
			And I'm the feet.

				CHEEBA
			Yo, you gotta show some patience.
			You want me to snap my fingers and
			presto chango - you're an overnight
			sensation.  Son, there is no such
			thing.

				MANRAY
			I'm tired of waiting.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Delacroix sits at his desk, a ream of white bond paper in

ANGLE ON

Apartment.  Cheeba and Manray run to the window and look out.

THEIR POV

The street is filled with police cars, vans and wagons.
Helicopters hover overhead with their searchlights on the
building.

				CHEEBA
			Oh snap!  It's a raid!

Cheeba and Manray jump into their cloths.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Cops in riot gear storm into the tenement.  A police chief
barks over a speaker system.

				POLICE CHIEF
			Please evacuate this building.  All
			of you are illegal residents of
			this condemned building.  Please
			leave immediately, by order of the
			Mayor of New York City, Rudolph

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stairwell.  It's bedlam.  The hundreds of SQUATTERS who have

NYPD as they ""bumrush the show.""

ANGLE ON

He jumps out of bed.

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT

				SLOAN
			Oh my God!!!

She too jumps out of bed.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING

It is a MADHOUSE, BEDLAM.  It's PANDEMONIUM.  The Squatters
are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement.
Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their
arrests and fill the ""Paddy"" wagons.

ANGLE ON

Street.  The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				DELACROIX
			How did you know?

				SLOAN
			It hit me like a ton of bricks.

				DELACROIX
			How can this be?  You and me at the
			same time, the exact same thought.
			It's scary.

				SLOAN
			The idea was out there in the

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Cheeba and Manray run down the fire escape and just elude a
group of cops.

ANGLE ON

Fence.  They lay still as the Fuzz run past them.

Manray looks at his friend, he knows he is right, at least
this time.

EXT. CNS BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Delacroix and Sloan sip hot coffee as they stand in front of
their office building.

				DELACROIX
			Manray was under our nose the whole
			time.

				SLOAN
			Do you know how you will use him?

				DELACROIX
			Not yet, but this thing will never
			get made.

										  18.


				SLOAN
			You lost me.

				DELACROIX
			Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And
			that's what I'm going to give him,
			it's going to be so racist, so
			negative, he won't have the balls
			to put it on the air.  Hence I'll
			prove my point.

				SLOAN
			What point is that?

				DELACROIX
			The point being that him, the
			networks don't want Black people on
			television unless they are buffoons.

				SLOAN
			Sounds risky to me.

				DELACROIX
			You getting cold feet?

				SLOAN
			I'm in till the end.

				DELACROIX
			Good.  I'm going to need your
			support.

				SLOAN
			Can't you just quit?  Walk away?

				DELACROIX
			And lose out on my money?  The only
			way I get paid is if I get fired.
			And that's what I intend to do.

EXT. CNS BUILDING - NEW DAY

It is pouring rain and Delacroix and Sloan huddle under an
umbrella.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			Everything was going according to

EXT. CNS BUILDING - NEXT MORNING

It is a sunny and pleasant morning.  Again, Sloan and
Delacroix hold vigil.

				SLOAN
			Maybe something happened to them.
			Maybe they're lying in an alley
			bleed to death.

				DELACROIX
			Manray better not be bleeding to
			death.  I need him.  After we're
			done he can do whatever he wants to
			do, until then, he's ours.

										  20.


				SLOAN
			You're beginning to sound like
			Dunwitty.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Manray and Cheeba stand across the street from their former
residence.  All of the doors and windows have been boarded
up and two cops stand watch.  They both look defeated, dirty
and hungry.

INT. CNS LOBBY - NEXT DAY

Sloan gets off the elevator and sees a skirmish.  TWO
SECURITY GUARDS are trying to escort Manray and Cheeba out
of the building.

				CHEEBA
			His name is Delapoint.

				SECURITY GUARD #1
			WE have no one by that name.

				CHEEBA
			Delapot.  Dela-something.

				SECURITY GUARD #2
			De La Soul ain't here either.
			Let's go.  Out.  Off the premises.

Manray turns around and sees Sloan.

				MANRAY
			Sloan!  She knows us.

The security guard stops.

				SLOAN
			It's alright.  They are associates
			of Mr. Delacroix.

				SECURITY GUARD #1
			Sorry, Ms. Hopkins.  They both
			walked in off the street without an
			appointment.

				SECURITY GUARD #2
			Do you need an escort?

				SLOAN
			That won't be needed.

										  21.


INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY

He sits in front of his TV and watches a tape of the old
""Amos 'n' Andy"" show.  Sloan leads Manray and Cheeba in.

				DELACROIX
			Eureka!  Where've you been?

He hugs them both.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Sloan and I have been looking all
			over for you.

				CHEEBA
			You'd take no offense if we called
			you DeLa for short?

				DELACROIX
			No offense.

				CHEEBA
			Manray needs a job.

Delacroix smiles at Sloan.

				MANRAY
			We got evicted from our home.
			We've both been on the streets for
			the last week.

				CHEEBA
			We was coming to see you.

				MANRAY
			If it's not too much trouble could
			you order us some food?

				CHEEBA
			We're starving.

				DELACROIX
			I apologize.  What would you like
			to eat?  Anything you want.

TIME CUT

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY

A feast of McDonald's is taking place.  Cheeba and Manray
are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries
into their mouths.  They were famished.

										  22.


				DELACROIX
			I have this concept for a TV pilot.
			There's no guarantee it will get
			made but regardless, you'll still
			make some money.

				CHEEBA
			How much?

				DELACROIX
			First things first.  I have to know
			if Manray is up for this.

				MANRAY
			What do I have to do?

				DELACROIX
			Some tap dancing, some singing.

				MANRAY
			Where do I sign?

				CHEEBA
			What kind of show is this gonna be?

				DELACROIX
			Different.

				MANRAY
			How different?

				DELACROIX
			Trust me.  Of course I still have
			to pitch it to my boss, but we'll
			have an answer one way or the other.

				MANRAY
			DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get
			to hoof and get paid too!!!

				DELACROIX
			That's right.  Money turns the wheel.

				CHEEBA
			What about in the mean time?  Not
			the in between time?

				DELACROIX
			You'll both get an advance and you
			can stay with me.

				MANRAY
			Bet.

										  23.


				DELACROIX
			I would like to change your name.

				MANRAY
			To what?

				DELACROIX
			You're now Mantan.

				MANRAY
			Mantan?  I don't even care as long
			as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me,
			I need some new kicks.

EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks
next to Sloan.

				MANRAY
			I never had a really real pair
			before.

				SLOAN
			You've never had any formal
			training, either?

				MANRAY
			Not a class, not a thing, just
			picked stuff up by myself.

				SLOAN
			I wish I had your natural talent.
			God only makes that visit once in a
			while.

				MANRAY
			You sing and dance?

				SLOAN
			A little.  I just graduated from
			NYU film school.  Cinema studies.

				MANRAY
			So what's up with you and DeLa?

				SLOAN
			What do you mean?

				MANRAY
			Are you and him kicking it?
			Knocking boots.
			Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.

										  24.


				SLOAN
			No, we're not knocking boots.  I
			got this internship while I still
			was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with
			my get up and go and hired me to be
			his assistant.

				MANRAY
			I'm sure that was the only thing he
			was impressed with.  You look
			beautiful like that.

				SLOAN
			If that was suppose to be a
			compliment, I thank you.

				MANRAY
			You're welcome.  You shouldn't give
			up on performing.

				SLOAN
			Why do you say that?  You've never
			seen me.

				MANRAY
			I think that would probably make
			you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing,
			I mean really doing my thing,
			hitting it, nothing compares to
			that feeling in the world.

				SLOAN
			I envy you.  That's the way I want
			to feel about my work.

EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT

Sloan walks from the subway to her block.

ANGLE ON

Street.  A huge black Chevy Suburban follows her, all the
windows are tinted jet black, you cannot see it all into it.
She notices the vehicle and starts to walk faster.

ANGLE ON

Corner.  As Sloan tries to cross at the corner, the Suburban
pulls up in front of her, blocking her path.

ANGLE ON

Suburban.  A tall black man jumps out of the Chevy.  This is
BIG BLACK.

										  25.


				BIG BLACK
			Li'l Sister.

ANGLE ON

Corner.

				SLOAN
			You idiot.  You almost gave me a
			massive coronary.

				BIG BLACK
			I didn't mean to scare you like that.

				SLOAN
			Well you did.

				BIG BLACK
			Give me some?

				SLOAN
			I'm not huggin' you in the middle
			of the street.  You must be crazy,
			Julius.

				BIG BLACK
			Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done
			told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't
			my name, you better recognize
			Hopkins was our slave name.  My
			true name is...

				SLOAN
			I'm not callin you Big Black Africa.
			Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.

				BIG BLACK
			BIG BLACK is the first name and
			AFRICA is the last.

He hugs her, she becomes lost in his huge arms and laughs.

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Big Black is rummaging through his sister's refrigerator.

				BIG BLACK
			Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food
			up in here in dis' piece.

				SLOAN
			I order out mostly.  So what do I
			owe this visit to?

										  26.


				BIG BLACK
			My group we need some exposure.
			Was wondering if you could hook a
			brother up?

				SLOAN
			Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You
			must be smoking.  Why in the world
			would I want to hook up a bunch of
			red, black and green flag-waving
			pseudo revolutionairies?

				BIG BLACK
			So now I see where you're coming
			from.  Just because we ain't
			rapping about Gucci, Timberland,
			Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and
			bitches, we're pseudo.

				SLOAN
			Who are you revolting against?

				BIG BLACK
			We're revolting against the powers
			that be, that been enslaving the
			minds and hearts of all people of
			color.  And we won't stop rapping
			till we bring about the overthrow
			of the government of the U.S. of A.

				SLOAN
			Please.

				BIG BLACK
			If you were really down you would
			get us together with that boss of
			yours.  What's his name again?

				SLOAN
			Delacroix.

				BIG BLACK
			Yeah, him.

				SLOAN
			What makes you think he would write
			a show about the Mau-Mau's.

				BIG BLACK
			C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a
			show.  Look at all that other junk
			that's on TV.  We got underground
			cult following.

										  27.


				SLOAN
			You don't have the demographics.

				BIG BLACK
			So are you telling me that you
			wouldn't even introduce me to
			Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm
			talking 'bout me, your only brother,
			ya own flesh and blood, hook a
			brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.

				SLOAN
			That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not
			blowin' my young career, brother or
			no brother, for you or anybody else.

				BIG BLACK
			There is a name, a term for your
			kind, the likes of you.  Back in
			slavery days, you would be
			classified as a house nigga.

				SLOAN
			If you think I'm a house nigga then
			that's your prerogative.  You got
			your ways to affect change, I have
			mine.  And I would appreciate it
			very much if you took ya field
			nigga ass out of my house.

				BIG BLACK
			My own sister throwin' me out.  I
			hope to seeya later when you get ya
			mind right.  Don't bother letting
			me out.

				SLOAN
			That's mighty black of you.

Big Black slams the door.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

One by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the
sofa.

				DUNWITTY
			Delacroix, I'm glad you got your
			mind right.

				DELACROIX
			It's right and tight.  Good morning,
			let me introduce you to everybody.
			You know my assistant, Sloan.

										  28.


				SLOAN
			Hello.

				DELACROIX
			This is Cheeba.

				CHEEBA
			Nice to meet you.

				DELACROIX
			And this is Manray.

				MANRAY
			How do you do?

				DUNWITTY
			Good.  I like the names.  Very
			theatrical.

				DELACROIX
			We're all happy to be here and I'm
			going to paint a picture for you.

				DUNWITTY
			I'm wid it.

				DELACROIX
			I've done a lot of soul searching
			and once again you are right.  In
			my previous work it's been all
			surface, superficial.  I have never
			really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As
			Mark Twain fully understood satire
			is the way.  Race has always been a
			hot button in this country's
			history and it needs to be pushed
			harder.  If we are ever to live
			side by side in peace and harmony.
			It's about promoting racial healing.

				DUNWITTY
			Go on.  Good so far.

				DELACROIX
			I know you're familiar with minstrel
			shows.  They came about at the turn
			of the 19th century.  It was a
			variety show in which the talent
			was in blackface - singing, dancing,
			telling jokes, doing skits.
			Dunwitty, I ask you when was the
			last time there was a good variety
			show on the air.  Carol Burnett?
			HeeHaw?

										  29.


				DUNWITTY
			Word!!!

				DELACROIX
			So let's take this great form, this
			very American tradition of
			entertainment into the 21st century,
			into the new millennium.

				DUNWITTY
			The name of the show?

				DELACROIX
			It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW
			MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

				DUNWITTY
			I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know?
			Because I'm getting a boner, my
			Johnson is hard, no disrespect my
			sister.

Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			I'm feelin' dis'!

				DELACROIX
			It will take a lot of courage and
			backbone on the part of the CNS to
			get this on the air.  In fact, I
			would understand fully if the
			subject matter is deemed too
			risque, too controversial.

				DUNWITTY
			Don't worry about that, that's my
			department.  Now who do we cast?
			We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or
			dance?

				DELACROIX
			I don't know if Whoopi is the way
			to go.

				DUNWITTY
			Are these our two stars, sitting
			here in front of my nose?  Which
			one is Mantan again?

				MANTAN
			That's me.

										  30.


				DELACROIX
			And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.

CLOSE ON

Cheeba.  A look of surprise is on his face.  Complete, utter
surprise.

				DUNWITTY
			That's a great handle.

				DELACROIX
			Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real
			coons.  I know we're way out there
			but it's satire.

				DUNWITTY
			I want you take it there.  All the
			way to the edge and back.

Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.

				DELACROIX
			Every week we follow the trials and
			tribulations of two real coons -
			Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky
			Duo.

				DUNWITTY
			What are there character traits?

				DELACROIX
			Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and
			unlucky.

				DUNWITTY
			Exactly!

				DELACROIX
			Mantan is an uneducated Negro who
			always by some stroke of
			unbelievable stupidity makes his
			best laid plans go haywire.

				DUNWITTY
			And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical
			sidekick?

				DELACROIX
			Yep, you guessed it.

				DUNWITTY
			This could be bigger than ""Amos and
			Andy.""

										  31.


				DELACROIX
			Protest finally forced ""Amos and
			Andy"" off the air.  Could stop us
			from ever getting on.

				DUNWITTY
			Let'em try.  I will kill to make
			this happen.

Delacroix looks at Sloan.

				DELACROIX
			Negroes would be in an uproar.

				DUNWITTY
			So what.  We would just give the
			NAACP a donation that would be the
			end of that.  No such thing as bad
			publicity.  So what.  Earlier you
			said singing and dancing.

				DELACROIX
			Mantan right here is a gifted
			hoofer.  He has educated feet.

				DUNWITTY
			Who are the other characters?

				DELACROIX
			Do we have characters?  How about
			Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus,
			Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny,
			and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.

Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one.

				DUNWITTY
			We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY
			on dis' one.  What's the setting?

				DELACROIX
			In the projects.  Like Eddie
			Murphy's ""The PJ's.""

				DUNWITTY
			Ya first bad move.  Projects been
			done.  That's one of the problems
			now, everything, movies, TV, are
			set in the urban jungle, da hood.
			That's so tired.  Mantan's
			Millennium Minstrel Show should be
			set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
				(MORE)

										  32.


				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			And every week these Alabama porch
			monkeys will make us cry, make us
			laugh, make us look at our own
			humanity.  Make us feel good to be
			alive.

				DELACROIX
			I don't know about that plantation
			angle.

				DUNWITTY
			What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's
			the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're
			movin' fast.  What does everybody
			else think about this?

				SLOAN
			We'd get a lot of mail.

She laughs, it's a fake one at that.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn't be
			another show like it.

				CHEEBA
			I've always wanted to be on
			television.

				DUNWITTY
			I like you.  Sleep 'n Eat.  That's
			funny.  Mantan, how do you feel
			about performing in black face?

				MANTAN
			As long as the hoofing is real,
			that I can do my thing, I can
			blacken up.  Let me hit it, beats
			and rhythms, express myself.

				DUNWITTY
			Show me a little somethin' somethin'.

Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper
			than deep.

Mantan is ready.

										  33.


				MANTAN
			I'm gonna give you just a taste.
			My tap shoes are brand new.  I
			haven't trained 'em yet.

He starts to work out.

				MANTAN (CONT'D)
			Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms.  Beats,
			beats, beats.  No Fred Astaire
			here, baby.  Just rawness.

Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff
flying onto the floor.  And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up
on his desk and really starts hitting it.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.

CLOSE ON

Mantan, he's bringing it home.  With the final move, he
leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and FREEZES.

ANGLE ON

The office.

				DUNWITTY
			That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout.
			That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's
			off the hiz-hook!

				DELACROIX
			We think so.

				DUNWITTY
			Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?

				CHEEBA
			I play the straight man.  I do some
			singing and dancing also.  I also
			manage Mantan.

				DUNWITTY
			Oh you do so?

				CHEEBA
			I'm the man behind the man behind
			the man.

				DUNWITTY
			You da man.

										  34.


				CHEEBA
			No, you da man.

				DUNWITTY
			I'm gonna run upstairs with this.
			If CNS doesn't want to do this,
			somebody else will have da balls to
			pull the trigger.  I want to thank
			each and every one of you.  This is
			great, Delacroix.  I'll get back to
			you later today.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Cheeba and Mantan are walking in midtown Manhattan.  They
both have a pep in their step, money in their pockets, and a
roof over their heads.

				CHEEBA
			Life is beginning to look up.  It's
			all good in da neighborhood.

				MANTAN
			You might be right.

				CHEEBA
			Why are you smiling so?

His smile is a mile wide.

				MANTAN
			I'm not smiling.

				CHEEBA
			Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That
			hottie Sloan Hopkins.

				MANTAN
			It's that bad, huh?  It's all over
			my face.

				CHEEBA
			No shame in ya game.  She got ya
			nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open.
			Sloan's what we certified ladies'
			men call low hanging fruit.

				MANTAN
			Certified ladies' man, huh?

				CHEEBA
			She's also moorish.

										  35.


				MANTAN
			What's that?

				CHEEBA
			Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of
			dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.

				MANTAN
			Seconds and thirds, too.

				CHEEBA
			Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm
			a tri-sexual.

				MANTAN
			You'd try anything.  I got first
			dibs.  You get ya own stuff.

				CHEEBA
			Naw, just jokin'.  That's you.
			That's you.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Delacroix sits with Manray and Cheeba in the living room.

				DELACROIX
			I want you to start using the name
			Mantan and not Manray if you don't
			mind.

				MANRAY
			Why?

				DELACROIX
			You have to start getting into your
			character.

				CHEEBA
			At the risk of sounding ignorant...

Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray.

				CHEEBA (CONT'D)
			...don't say a word but who is this
			cat Mantan you keep talkin' 'bout?

Delacroix hits the remote button.  The TV and VCR are powered.

CLOSE ON

Television.  We see MANTAN MORELAND in some obscure movie.

										  36.


				DELACROIX (O.S.)
			This is Mantan Moreland.

CLOSER ON

Television.  Mantan reacts to seeing a ghost.

				DELACROIX (O.S.) (CONT'D)
			He was a clown, a buffoon but he
			was funny.

ANGLE ON

Living room.

				CHEEBA
			That ain't funny.

				MANRAY
			DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

				DELACROIX
			Gentlemen, the show, our show will
			be satirical.  You know what that
			is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.

				CHEEBA
			We might need some mo' money behind
			this.

				DELACROIX
			That can be done.

				MANRAY
			Mantan?

				DELACROIX
			Mantan!!

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

THE MAU-MAU's in full effect, bob their heads to the funky
track that blasts from the studio monitors.

ANGLE ON

Studio.  They pass around joints that look like they've been
on steroids and 64 ounce JUGULARS of DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR -
liquid crack, the preferred alcoholic beverage of GHETTO
NEGROES.  All the members of the MAU-MAU's are AFRICAN
AMERICAN except one.  There is one Caucasian member.  He
goes by the name 1/16th BLACK, the engineer tech-whiz kid
computer geek.

										  37.


				1/16TH BLACK
			Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for
			this joint.

				BIG BLACK
			How 'bout...

Big Black takes a long, long drag on a joint, then he
quickly empties a 64 oz. in one swing without missing a
beat, without missing a head nod.

				BIG BLACK (CONT'D)
			Black Iz Black?

The whole group goes crazy with the title of the song.

				DOUBLE BLACK
			That's da bomb.

				MO BLACK
			That's gonna give me some
			inspiration.

				JO BLACK
			Gonna make me get my flow on.

				BIG BLACK
			We should call dis da BLACK album.

Everyone starts high-fiving each other.

				SMOOTH BLACK
			Yo, check it out.  We have never
			conformed to none of the white
			man's rules and regulations and
			later for that ole slave owner
			Webster.  Therefore I respectfully
			submit BIG BLACK that we from now
			on, hence forth and whatnot spell
			BLACK: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K.

				HARD BLACK
			I feel dat.

				1/16TH BLACK
			B-L-A-K.  BLAK.  The darkest of all
			colors, the opposite of white.  A
			member of an African people.  But
			check it out, here's where the grey
			people try to get slick with their
			trickery.  Listen to the full
			connotations.  GLOOMY.  DEPRESSING.
			EVIL.  WICKED.  ANGRY.  SULLEN.
				(MORE)

										  38.


				1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D)
			BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL.
			Need I say more.

				BIG BLACK
			B-L-A-K it is.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A middle-aged African-American woman is working in the
kitchen.  Delacroix sits at the kitchen table talking with
her.  This is his MOM, ORCHID DOTHAN.

Orchid puts a plate of food in front of her son.

				ORCHID
			You must think I'm some kind of fool.

				DELACROIX
			It looks delicious.

				ORCHID
			You hear me talkin' to you.  The
			only time you come up here when
			something is wrong.

				DELACROIX
			C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that
			I'm an ungrateful son stuff.

				ORCHID
			I said no such thing.  All I said
			is that something must be wrong.

She sits down with him.

				ORCHID (CONT'D)
			How's the food?

				DELACROIX
			Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well,
			since you asked, it looks like I
			may have a new show, a pilot being
			shot.

				ORCHID
			That's wonderful.  Isn't that what
			you always wanted, a show of your
			own?

He talks between mouthfuls.

										  39.


				DELACROIX
			It was.  It is.  But this is a
			different kind of show.

				ORCHID
			If at first it's not what you want,
			just work that much harder, Peerless.

				DELACROIX
			Mommy, please don't call me that.

				ORCHID
			Son, Peerless is your name.  Now
			you might be one of these Hollywood
			types, change your name and all
			that but Peerless Dothan is on your
			birth certificate.

				DELACROIX
			I know what's on my birth
			certificate.  You heard from Daddy?

				ORCHID
			I guess he's still on the road.
			What kind of show is this?  Are
			they some Negroes in it without
			being buffoons?

				DELACROIX
			To answer your question, there are
			a lot of Negroes in it and what is
			your definition of buffoons?

				ORCHID
			Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon.
			We have enough of those on
			television already.

				DELACROIX
			Please let me know when you hear
			from Daddy, get a number or
			something.

				ORCHID
			I will.  And good luck with your
			show.  I hope it's a huge success.
			You've worked very hard.  You
			deserve it.

Delacroix gets up from his seat and hugs his mother.

										  40.


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A celebration is going on as Delacroix, Sloan, Cheeba and
Mantan sit at a table.

ANGLE ON

Table.  Cheeba and Mantan are giddy.  Sloan looks at
Delacroix who is visibly not happy.

				SLOAN
			You okay?

				DELACROIX
			I feel like somebody hit me upside
			da head with a sledgehammer.

				CHEEBA
			DeLa - what's the matter with you.

				MANTAN
			You ain't happy about the green
			light?

				SLOAN
			People show their happiness in a
			lot of different ways.

				MANTAN
			Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a
			funeral.

				DELACROIX
			I'm happy for all of us.  It's just
			we have a great responsibility now.
			The pressure is on.

				MANTAN
			Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know
			what the hell real pressure is.
			SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff.
			Now when you scramblin' out on the
			street in da January winter and the
			hawk is talkin' to you with NO
			money and NO prospects of money
			anytime soon, now that there is
			some pressure.

				DELACROIX
			I didn't mean it to sound like that.

										  41.


				MANTAN
			That's the way it came out.  Let me
			ask you one question.  Have you
			ever been in want, in need your
			entire privileged life?

				DELACROIX
			Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because
			I didn't grow up on food stamps and
			welfare?  Because I didn't call
			home a cardboard box?  No, I never
			ever went to bed hungry and I'm
			proud of it, too.  Whoever told you
			that living in poverty earns you
			somekind of badge of honor flat out
			lied to you.

				MANTAN
			The point I'm trying to make is
			that this is a blessing.  It's
			going to be fun doing this show and
			we should all look at it that way.

Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves.

				CHEEBA
			What's wrong with him?

				MANTAN
			Must be the pressure.

Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap.  A highly
attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.
This is JESSICA GRILLO.

				JESSICA
			Sorry I'm late.

Cheeba and Mantan are in awe.

				SLOAN
			Hey, girl.  This is my best friend,
			Jessica Grillo.  I invited her down
			to celebrate with us.

				CHEEBA
			I'm Cheeba.

				MANTAN
			I'm Mantan.

They both rise.

										  42.


				CHEEBA
			Please, have a seat.

				MANTAN
			Sloan never told us she had friends
			like you.

				CHEEBA
			In fact, we never knew she had any
			friends period.

				SLOAN
			Later for you.

				JESSICA
			She has a lot of friends

				CHEEBA
			Male?

				JESSICA
			Yes.

				MANTAN
			A lot?

				SLOAN
			Enough.

Sloan and Jessica laugh at the expense of these guys.

				JESSICA
			I propose a toast.

She grabs an empty glass and pours herself some champagne.

				JESSICA (CONT'D)
			To the success of your show.  Good
			luck.

Everyone raises their glasses.  CLINK!

				SLOAN
			Excuse me.

Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix.

ANGLE ON

Steps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Wait here.

										  43.


She goes to the ladies' cubicle.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix.  He leans against the wall.

ANGLE ON

Bathroom door.  Sloan comes out, grabs him inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM - NIGHT

Sloan locks the door.

				SLOAN
			What is your problem?

				DELACROIX
			My problem is MANTAN THE NEW
			MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

				SLOAN
			Why did you even come up with that
			shit if you didn't want it made?

				DELACROIX
			It was the principle.  Dunwitty had
			to be enlightened.  I was making a
			point.  I take pride in my work.
			Plus, I already told you I wasn't
			gonna walk away from my money.

				SLOAN
			Fuck da money.  Why do through all
			this effort?  Why?  Are you looking
			for love from Dunwitty?  For
			respect?  Dunwitty and his likes
			don't give a goddamn about you.  So
			now what are you gonna do?

Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
			Will you please let me in?  I have
			to use the toilet.

				SLOAN
			You're gonna have to hold it in
			because we're not finished yet...

She returns her attention to Delacroix.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			...QUIT then.

										  44.


				DELACROIX
			Even if money wasn't an issue,
			Dunwitty will still go ahead
			without me and that could be more
			dangerous.

				SLOAN
			What's the chances of MANTAN being
			picked up?

				DELACROIX
			I wouldn't bet against it.  My
			Negroidal ass is stuck between the
			proverbial rock and a hard place.

				SLOAN
			Like I said, all this for some
			twisted, distorted sense of
			principal.  Dunwitty, he just
			tolerates your Negroidal ass, he
			doesn't respect it.

The banging starts again.

				MANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
			Please open this bathroom door
			immediately.  You are being very
			inconsiderate.

Sloan unlocks the door and they exit.

ANGLE ON

Ladies' bathroom.  Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange
looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the
bathroom as they rush in.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

				DELACROIX
			I strongly feel that a Negro should
			direct this.  This kind of satire
			is a high wire act in a gale storm.
			One misstep and we're doing ""Amos
			and Andy.""  Only a Negro will have
			the sensitivity and cultural
			awareness to navigate this dangerous
			terrain.

				DUNWITTY
			To hire someone solely on their
			ethnicity, gender or religion is
			not right.  It's un-American.  I
			will hire someone who is most
			qualified for this particular job.

										  45.


				DELACROIX
			I was hoping to perhaps direct some
			episodes myself, if not the pilot
			soon after.

				DUNWITTY
			I want a hot, young white director.
			Maybe the kid, that pheenom who
			just did that hot new sexy Madonna
			video.

				DELACROIX
			You're telling me some white boy is
			gonna direct this pilot?

				DUNWITTY
			I just want you to meet him.  Keep
			an open mind.

				DELACROIX
			Besides, what does he know about
			Negroes?

				DUNWITTY
			Probably nuthin', but that's why
			it's such a sexy way to go.
			Sometimes an outsider has a fresh
			new outlook, a different unique
			perspective.  A black director,
			y'know what he's gonna do given the
			subject matter?  With this kid, the
			possibilities are endless.

				DELACROIX
			What are his qualifications besides
			being a white male and directing a
			hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

				DUNWITTY
			If Spielburg can direct ""The Color
			Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid
			can direct the Mantan pilot.

				DELACROIX
			That's exactly my point.  Has he
			even directed actors before in
			anything?

				DUNWITTY
			No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's
			all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even
			let you choose your own musical
			director.  You can have that.

										  46.


				DELACROIX
			In the immortal words of Derrick
			Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!

				DUNWITTY
			Derrick Coleman, he possessed all
			the talent in the world, coulda,
			shoulda, been a great ballplayer
			but alas D.C. didn't want it bad
			enough.  Delacroix, do you want it?
			Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you
			want it that much.

Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY

Delacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix

He surveys the room.

P.O.V. - DELACROIX

All of the writers are Caucasian - male and female.  Every
single last one.

ANGLE ON

Conference room.  Delacroix and Sloan sit down at the head
of the long oval table.

				DELACROIX
			Good morning, for those of you who
			don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix.
			I'm running things and this here is
			my assistant Sloan Hopkins.

				SLOAN
			Hello.

				DELACROIX
			I've never worked with any of you
			and you've never worked with me so
			we'll be starting from scratch.
			I'm a fair person, a straight
			shooter and I don't hold my tongue.
			Everybody up in here should know I
			had nothing to do with you being
			hired.
				(MORE)

										  47.


				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			I would have preferred at least one
			other Negro writer.  Any questions?
			Comments?

MONA raises her hand.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Yes, your name?

				MONA
			He, I'm Mona.

				DELACROIX
			Hi, Mona.

				MONA
			I perfectly understand where you're
			coming from.  As a minority I can
			relate to your struggle also.  But
			I think you should give us all a
			chance.  We want this pilot to be
			successful just as much as you.
			Please don't be so quick to judge
			us based only on our whiteness.

				DELACROIX
			Oh, is that what I'm doing?

BETH jumps in.

				BETH
			I think because of our background
			we can bring a unique perspective
			to Mantan.

SETH pipes in also.

				SETH
			A fresh pair of eyes.  A new look,
			insight, new angle that hasn't been
			seen before.

				DELACROIX
			I've heard this somewhere before.

David raises his hand.

										  48.


				DAVID
			My name is David.  I do think it
			would be better to have some
			African-American writers but for
			whatever reason they are not here.
			I don't know if they couldn't find
			any people with experience, they
			wouldn't work for the pay or
			refused to work for the show.  I
			don't know and nobody in this room
			probably knows either.  I'm looking
			at this as a unique opportunity.
			We all should.  I'm a damn good
			writer and I'm ready to go to work.

Everyone in the room applauds.  Sloan looks at Delacroix.

FREEZE FRAME

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			This thing was rigged, the deck was
			stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don
			King be near?  Good thing Sloan had
			my back.  She's my rock.  This was
			going to be a whole lot of work.

UN-FREEZE FRAME

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			David, I appreciate your comments.
			Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody
			just talk out loud.

				MONA
			I've always liked the format of
			Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN.""

				ANNA
			That could be cool.

				KIRK
			What about something like ""The
			Jeffersons?""  I grew up in Idaho so
			that's how I got my understanding
			of black people.  Through Sherman
			Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.

				DAVID
			""Good Times"" was better.  Kid Dy-no
			mite!!!

										  49.


				AARON
			You pole are going to far back for
			me.  I think we have to go after a
			hipper feel.  Like the stuff Eddie
			Murphy used to do on ""Saturday
			Night Live.""

				PETER
			Or Martin.  You go girl.

				JEFF
			What about the  black exploitation
			films?  No one has ever tried
			making that work on TV.

				DAVID
			And for reason.  Have you ever seen
			""Scream Blacula, Scream?""

				MONA
			I think, and Delacroix will agree
			with me, the politics of this show
			have to be right.  We should always
			be laughing with our characters,
			not at them.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets
them jerk off.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			The mission was accomplished.  All
			of these people left the room
			thinking they would have real input.
			I was writing this pilot alone,
			myself, me.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A long line reaches down the block and around the corner.
It's a ""cattle call,"" open auditions for ""Mantan.""

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			Now came the fun part, finding the
			talented performers to cast in the
			show.

WE DOLLY past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed
African American actors, many of them dressed in various
costumes.

										  50.


				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			Everybody and their mother was
			trying to get in, trying to be seen.
			Trying to get their piece of the
			rock.

INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

Delacroix sits in the first row with Sloan, RUTH, an African
American casting director.  LEVI, the musical director, also
black, is on the stage at the piano.

AUDITION MONTAGE

WE SEE singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians,
rappers.  Some good, most are terrible.  Many come out on
stage dressed like mammies, Stepin' Fetchit, slaves, pimps,
ho's, hustlers, and basketball players.  It is a cavalcade
of all the stereotypical roles one has seen.

ANGLE ON

Space.  LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of
""WAY DOWN ON THE SWANEE RIVER.""

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			This was amazing.  Who had told
			these Negroes that this was what we
			were looking for?  The same old
			image, it damn for sure wasn't me.

CLOSE ON

Lulu.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			Were people this desperate to get
			work?

CLOSE ON

Delacroix.  He interrupts Lulu.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Thanks, Ms. Lulu.

				LULU
			But I had several more poems.

				DELACROIX
			That's good.  We've seen enough.
			We'll get back to you.

Lulu scurries off stage.

										  51.


				RUTH (O.S.)
			Next.

The Mau-Mau's run onto the stage, yelling and screaming.

They are all fired up, in fact several fire their 9mm's into
the ceiling.

ANGLE - TWO SHOT

Delacroix and Sloan.

				SLOAN
			This is the group I was telling you
			about.

				DELACROIX
			Which one is your brother?

				SLOAN
			The big one.

Ruth.

				RUTH
			Let's get started here.

ANGLE ON

STAGE

Big Black preens around on the stage.

				BIG BLACK
			The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place.
			That's right, the Mau-Mau's.

				DELACROIX (O.S.)
			What's your name?

				BIG BLACK
			My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

				DELACROIX (O.S.)
			And what are the Mau-Mau's going to
			do for us today?

				BIG BLACK
			We gonna drop some knowledge,
			wisdom and understanding.  The Mau-
			Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop
			science.

										  52.


CLOSE ON

Sloan, who's trying to disappear.  If she sits any lower
she'll be under her seat.

ON DELACROIX

				DELACROIX
			We're ready when you are.

ON STAGE

				BIG BLACK
			Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One.
			Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots
			to give my peeps some props.
			Brothers introduce yourself.

				DOUBLE BLACK
			Yo, I'm Double Black.

				BLACK BLACK
			Check it, Black Black.

				SMOOTH BLACK
			I'm Smooth Black, the lover in dis'
			piece.

				HARD BLACK
			Hard Black.

				MO BLACK
			He's Jo Black.

				JO BLACK
			And he's Mo Black.

				1/16TH BLACK
			I'm last but not least, you can
			call me 1/16th Black.

ON DELACROIX

				DELACROIX
			Good.  We're really blacked-oops,
			backed up, so shall we begin?

ON STAGE

				BIG BLACK
			Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One.
			Two.  Yo, the name of this joint is
			BLAK IZ BLAK.  Hit it.

										  53.


The booming track starts and the Mau-Mau's do their thing,
bouncing all over the stage.  The lyrics about everything
that is BLAK!!!

ON DELACROIX

A look of disbelief is on his face.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			Needless to say, the Mau-Mau's did
			not fit into our plans.

ON SLOAN

She's in shock, horrified.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			As I told Sloan, there's a black
			sheep in every family.

BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY

Delacroix is screaming at the top of his lungs.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Finland.  This is a travesty.  A
			debacle.  A mockery.

INT. LOBBY

Dunwitty approaches Delacroix in the lobby of the rehearsal
space.  He is with JUKKA, a young, very young blonde kid.

				DUNWITTY
			Delacroix.  This is the director I
			was telling you about.  Jukka Laks.

				JUKKA
			So nice to meet you.

				DELACROIX
			Nice to meet you.  If you don't
			mind me asking you - how old are you?

				JUKKA
			I just turned twenty.

				DUNWITTY
			I'm gonna leave you two creative
			geniuses alone.

				DELACROIX
			Dunwitty, don't leave.

										  54.


Dunwitty is out.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Where are you from?

				JUKKA
			Helsinki, which is the capital of
			Finland.

				DELACROIX
			Finland.

				JUKKA
			You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?

				DELACROIX
			Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever
			seen a Negro person before?  Even
			had a real conversation with a real
			Negro before?

				JUKKA
			What's a Negro.

INT. BACKSTAGE

Delacroix continues to rant and rave.  Sloan is unsuccessful
in attempting to make him be quiet.

				DELACROIX
			A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle.
			An abomination.

INT. LOBBY

				DELACROIX
			Did you just ask me what's a Negro?
			I'M A NEGRO!!!

				JUKKA
			Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term
			before.  I thought you were BLACK
			of African-American.  No?

				DELACROIX
			Well before there was BLACK or
			AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were
			NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.

				JUKKA
			Thank you for correcting my
			ignorance.  I'm looking forward to
			working side by side with you.  I
			feel we make a good team.

										  55.


				DELACROIX
			How did you get this gig?

				JUKKA
			My visual style is very erotic,
			sexy, how do you say - hot?

				DELACROIX
			This is a TV show, not a music video.

				JUKKA
			Then will you teach me what I need
			to know.  Maybe we learn from each
			other, if that's possible, no?

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

				DELACROIX
			This is a travesty.  A debacle.

				SLOAN
			You've said that already.

				DELACROIX
			I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my
			throat.  For the love of Joseph.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NEW DAY

He's sitting behind his desk, reading new ""pink"" revisions
of the ""MANTAN"" pilot.  He screams.

				DELACROIX
			For the love of Joseph and Mary.

Delacroix bolts out from his office.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - DAY

Delacroix charges in as Dunwitty and Jukka go over the same
""pink"" revisions.

				DELACROIX
			I will not be held responsible for
			these revisions.  These changes are
			not the way I want to go.  This is
			an outrage.  This is a sham.  A
			violation!

				DUNWITTY
			Calm down, please.

				JUKKA
			In Finland, when we get upset...

										  56.


				DELACROIX
			I don't give a good goddamn about
			Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever
			ya blond ass came from.

				DUNWITTY
			We just punched it up a bit.  Made
			it funnier.

				DELACROIX
			Funnier to who and at who's expense?
			Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run
			amok, the boycotts, when the
			demostrations commence, I'm giving
			them your home address.  Let's see
			how you like it when they picket
			your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.

				DUNWITTY
			I seriously doubt that will ever
			happen.  Didn't I tell you I know
			your people better than you do.
			But if by some miracle you're
			correct, I'm gonna invite them
			inside my house and we'll have a
			sit down, discuss it like civil
			human beings.

INT. STUDIO - NIGHT

Much activity is going on.  People are moving to and fro.

Delacroix knocks and they enter.

INT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM

Mantan sits in front of his mirror.

				DELACROIX
			Just want to say good luck.

				SLOAN
			Break a leg.

She gives Mantan a kiss on his cheek.

				DELACROIX
			Wait a minute.  Hold up.

They all laugh.

										  57.


				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Can I kiss you too?

				MANTAN
			Naw.  I'll take the zero.

				DELACROIX
			You feel good, not nervous?

				MANTAN
			I feel fine.

				DELACROIX
			Not nervous?  Relaxed?

				MANTAN
			Sloan, will you take your boss out
			of here so I can get ready.

EXT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Sloan and Delacroix enter the dressing room.

INT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			How's the audience?

				DELACROIX
			Fired up.

				SLOAN
			How you feelin'?

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			Good.  I'm not sure about this
			material.

				DELACROIX
			The material is fine.

Sloan cuts a look at this liar.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			You really think so?

				DELACROIX
			We're trying to do something new
			here, some groundbreaking stuff.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			It's the bone breaking stuff I'm
			worried about.

										  58.


				SLOAN
			Everything's gonna be alright.  You
			and Mantan will be huge stars after
			tonight.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			You really think so?

				DELACROIX
			Your life will never be the same.

				SLOAN
			Let's leave the man in peace so he
			can get ready.

INT. BACKSTAGE

				SLOAN
			We both lied to him.

				DELACROIX
			What do you want me to say?

				SLOAN
			Just don't lie to me.

				VERNA
			Nice to meet you.

				DELACROIX
			Same here.

				SLOAN
			The pleasure is mine.

				VERNA
			My husband has been raving about
			the awesome work you've done.  How
			did you ever think of something
			like this?  It's absolutely
			brilliant.  Pure genius.

				DELACROIX
			I guess it was divine inspiration.

				VERNA
			Hope to see you both after the
			taping.  Congrats in advance.

ON CONTROL BOOTH

Verna and Dunwitty go to the front of the control booth.

TWO SHOT

Delacroix and Sloan.

			Divine inspiration?

She laughs.

				DELACROIX
			I was trying to be nice.

										  60.


				SLOAN
			I want to apologize about my
			brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I
			should not have imposed them on you.

				DELACROIX
			C'mon.  You were only doing what
			family is supposed to be doing for
			family.  You gave your brother a
			shot.  That's all anybody can ask
			for, an opportunity, a chance, a
			shot.  He got his.

INT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

The audience is in an uproar when the lights go down.  They

FIELD.

										  63.


ON STAGE

First Sleep 'N Eat then Mantan shuffles onto the stage.

				MANTAN
			This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			And this is my very best friend
			Mantan.

				BOTH
			We're two real COONS!

The audience lets out nervous laughter.  They don't know
what to think.

				MANTAN
			We both left the hustle and bustle
			of Uptown, Harlem...

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			...the big apple, New York, New York.

				MANTAN
			To come back to our roots.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.

				MANTAN
			Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			Give or cousins some of dem educated

Mantan begins to do a slow, steady step.

				SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D)
			Cousins, first, second, third and
			distant, let's have Mantan take us
			all the way back to a much more
			simpler time.  A time wen men were
			men, women were women, and Neggras
			knew their place.

										  64.


The AUDIENCE is aghast.  Mantan has picked up the pace.
He's tapping fast and furious.

				MANTAN
			Cousins, I want all of you to go to
			your windows.  Go to your windows
			and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the
			drugs, the crack babies born out of
			wedlock to crackhead aids infested
			parents.  I'm tired of the inflated
			welfare rolls while good wholesome
			Americans bring less and less of
			their paycheck home every two weeks.
			I'm tired, you're tired, we're all
			tired of these so-called bible-
			thumping God fearing, whore mongling
			Professional athletes.  Aren't you
			tired of these basketball-dunking,
			football-running, hop-hip rapping
			ebonic-speaking sex offenders who
			got ten kids from ten different
			Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep
			'N Eat.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			You tellin' the truth.

				MANTAN
			Go to your windows and yell out,
			scream with all the life you can
			muster up inside your assaulted,
			bruised and battered bodies.  I'M
			SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M
			NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!

Mantan stops dancing and collapses.

They're stunned.  They can't believe what they've heard,
what they've seen.  What they've been witness to.

ON YOUNG WHITE COUPLE

They look at the black people in the audience.

ON YOUNG HIP-HOP BLACK MALE

He starts to clap slowly.

ON AUDIENCE

Slowly more black people begin to applaud.  Slowly it sweeps
up into the black people.

										  65.


The WHITE AUDIENCE, of course, has been waiting to see how
their black brothers and sisters would react.  Now feeling
comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause.

ON AUDIENCE

The applause changes into laughter.  It is not nervous
laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER.

ON BLACK AND WHITE FACES

The laughter is contagious.

ON STAGE

Mantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead.  He
slowly gets up from his prostate position as he HEARS:

A WAYBACK ALABAMA JIG played by the house band, THE PORCH
MONKEYS, led by musical director Levi.  Mantan is joined on
stage by the other hoofers in the show: JUNGLE BUNNY,
SNOWFLAKE, SAMBO, AUNT JEMIMA, RASTUS, NIGGER JIM, plus

			the CNS brass.  They saw some clips
			from the pilot and they're rushing
			it onto the air.  Yo, we're a
			midseason replacement, ordered 12
			shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya
			hear what I just said, Yo?

ON DUNWITTY

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			They didn't even view a rough cut,
			just some scenes we quickly cut
			together.

ON DELACROIX

				DELACROIX
			This has to be a big mistake.

				DUNWITTY (O.S.)
			The big mistake was my not believing
			in your genius earlier.  From the
			gitgo, from jump street.

				DELACROIX
			Hold on a sec, I got a call.

HE CLICKS OVER.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of
			this other call.

INT. BENZ - CONTINUOUS

				DELACROIX (O.S.)
			I gots to go, it's my Moms.

				DUNWITTY
			I want to meet her one day, please
			tell her the great news.  I'm OUT
			like Vanilla Ice.

INT. ORCHID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She is on the phone with her son.

										  67.


				ORCHID
			Peerless, your father called.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT

				DELACROIX
			I'll be right over.

INT. STREET - NIGHT

It's a warm summer night.

				MANTAN
			So what's up with you?

				SLOAN
			What do you want to know?

				MANTAN
			The good stuff.

				SLOAN
			I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my
			life.  Can't go anywhere without an
			inhaler.

				MANTAN
			What else?

				SLOAN
			Are you trying to rap to me?

INT. ORCHID'S HOUSE

Delacroix sits at the kitchen table.

				ORCHID
			He wants you to come and see him.

				DELACROIX
			He said that?

				ORCHID
			Yes he did.

				DELACROIX
			Where is he?

				ORCHID
			He's performing at some place
			outside of Richmond, Virginia.

				DELACROIX
			I can't go all the way down south.

										  68.


				ORCHID
			Richmond is not all the way down
			south.

				DELACROIX
			I don't even know why you're still
			concerned over him.  Daddy's not
			with you.

				ORCHID
			Regardless, he still is your father.

				DELACROIX
			It's gonna be hard for me to get
			away with the show taking off.

				ORCHID
			Even more reason to see him.  He'll
			be overjoyed with your success.

				DELACROIX
			C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been
			impressed with anything I've ever
			done.  From winning my fifth grade
			Spelling Bee to the present.

				ORCHID
			Peerless, last time, go see your
			father.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is
being said.  He sits up and starts to do a dance for her.
To her.

ON BENCH

Mantan is doing that ""Mating"" tap dance.

				SLOAN
			Are you trying to seduce me?

He puts his index finger over his mouth - ""Quiet.""

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			You think that's gonna work, huh?

He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps
then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position.

ON MANTAN AND SLOAN

They kiss.

										  69.


EXT. I-95 SOUTH - MORNING

Delacroix is driving ""down south.""

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself.  HE
SPEAKS TO US through the MIRROR

				DELACROIX
			I figured this was a good time to
			get away.  Just jump in my ride and
			go.  I always did my best thinking
			when I was driving alone.  I needed
			to think out clearly what I was
			going to do with this MANTAN - THE
			NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

EXT. I-95 SOUTH

Delacroix is driving on his way to ""Ole Virginny.""

EXT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK - NIGHT

Delacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink,
funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint.

CLOSE ON NEON SIGN

""MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK"" - most the letters do not light up,
underneath it, ""2-NITE - JUNEBUG.""

INT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK

It's loud as hell as Delacroix enters this smoky, dark
establishment.

P.O.V. DELACROIX

This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are
dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot
different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the
men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM,
the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from ""Luke"" video.

ON SUGAR SHAK

Delacroix works himself through the crowded BAR/DISCO into
another small room.

ON COMEDY ROOM

He walks into a small space where his father JUNEBUG is on
the stage.

										  70.


ON JUNEBUG

He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his
hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage
doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and
sips it often.

ON COMEDY ROOM

Delacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him.

ON DELACROIX

He looks around.

P.O.V. DELACROIX

It's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty.

ON TABLE

A couple gets loud, arguing over something.

ON JUNEBUG

				JUNEBUG
			'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please
			show me some respect.  I'm up here
			trying to make a living.

				MAN
			Mind yo' business.

				JUNEBUG
			Don't make me have to come over
			there and whoop you upside ya head.

The sparse AUDIENCE laughs.

				JUNEBUG (CONT'D)
			Just messin' with ya.  But please
			if you and your lady need to
			discuss something, take it outside.
			Thank you.

He continues on with his show.

ON TABLE

Delacroix walks over to the fighting couple.

										  71.


				DELACROIX
			Brother man, that's my father up
			there and I drove a long way to see
			him perform.  Please take this
			fifty, go buy you and the young
			lady some drinks in the club.

The guy looks him up and down.

				MAN
			That's yo' Daddy?

Delacroix nods.

				MAN (CONT'D)
			Don't need yo money for drinks.
			Besides, she's drunk already.
			C'mon, let's go.

The guy grabs his friend by the wrist and drags her kicking
and screaming out the room.

CLOSE ON JUNEBUG

				JUNEBUG
			Don't bring your woman out if you
			can't keep her in deep check.  If
			my woman ever did something crazy
			like that I'd put my size 12 dead
			up in her ass.

This gets the biggest laugh of the night.

EXT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Delacroix knocks.

				JUNEBUG (O.S.)
			What do you want?

				DELACROIX
			I want to speak with you.

				JUNEBUG (O.S.)
			Go away, unless you got my money.

				DELACROIX
			It's me, Peerless.

INT. DRESSING ROOM

He enters into a closet, it's a makeshift dressing room.  A
younger lady, much younger than Junebug - DOT - stands
behind him as she massages his neck.

										  72.


Junebug gets up from his chair, rushes to his son and they
embrace.

				JUNEBUG
			Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.

				DELACROIX
			It's been a long time.

				JUNEBUG
			Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me,
			this is my lady DOT.

				DELACROIX
			Pleased to meet you.

				DOT
			Glad to meet you, too.  You are all
			your father talks about.

				DELACROIX
			Is that so?

				JUNEBUG
			Honey, pour me and my son a drink.

They both sit down as drinks are poured.

				DOT
			I'll leave you two alone.

She kisses Junebug on the forehead before leaving.

				JUNEBUG
			Good woman.  I trained her right.

				DELACROIX
			Daddy, she's younger than me.

				JUNEBUG
			My game is still strong.  No Viagra
			for me, don't need no chemicals.
			Just my tonic.

He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp.

				JUNEBUG (CONT'D)
			Purely for medicinal purposes.

				DELACROIX
			I thought you had promised Mommy
			you stopped.

										  73.


				JUNEBUG
			I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I
			just like to drink.

				DELACROIX
			How did you end up here?

				JUNEBUG
			How did I end up at the third rate
			chittlin' circuit greasy hole in
			the wall in West Hell, Virginny?
			Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?

Delacroix takes a sip of his drink.

				DELACROIX
			That's what I'm askin'.

				JUNEBUG
			Because I had too much pride.  Too
			much integrity.  I wouldn't lick
			nobody's butt.  Some material I
			refused to do.

				DELACROIX
			Daddy, it can't be just because of
			that.  There had to be other factors.

Junebug pours himself another stiff one.

				JUNEBUG
			That's the only reason, period.
			They only want one certain kind of
			black comic.

				DELACROIX
			Another one of your conspiracies to
			hold ya career back?

				JUNEBUG
			All I know is what happened to me.
			All that other mess I just file
			into the ""life's too short"" category.

He downs another one.  Junebug drinks like a fish.

				JUNEBUG (CONT'D)
			Enough about me, what's happening
			with you?

				DELACROIX
			The same old, same old.  Trying to
			get my stuff through.

										  74.


				JUNEBUG
			Dem white boys giving you a hard
			time?

				DELACROIX
			Nuthin' I can't handle.

				JUNEBUG
			The truth is never let them seeya
			sweat.  You do that, that's half
			the battle.

				DELACROIX
			Where do you go from here?

				JUNEBUG
			Three nights Charleston, South
			Carolina.

				DELACROIX
			I didn't mean that, in life.

				JUNEBUG
			In life?  I'ma keep on living,
			having a good drink, got me a good
			young woman, make a couple of
			dollars and make people laugh.
			Haven't I always tol' you all
			nigga's are entertainers?  The
			question is what are you gonna do,
			Peerless?

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Delacroix and Dot are on either side of Junebug as they hold
him up.

ON DOOR

Delacroix struggles to put the key in the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

The door is kicked open as the trio comes in.  Junebug is
drunk as a skunk.

				JUNEBUG
			I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like
			to drink.

				DOT
			We know that baby.

										  75.


				DELACROIX
			Let's get him over to the bed.

				JUNEBUG
			Baby, you treat me so good.
			Peerless, you're a good son, I love
			you.  You never gave me no trouble.

They lay him down on the bed.

				DELACROIX
			I love you too, Daddy.

				JUNEBUG
			Always keep 'em laughing.

Dot takes off his shoes.  He's out like a light.  Gone.

				DELACROIX
			How long has my father been like
			this?

				DOT
			Not that often.  He was excited to
			see you.

				DELACROIX
			So he drank himself into a stuper?

				DOT
			The drinking is for the pain.  It
			doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

				DELACROIX
			So what's up with you?

				DOT
			I was a hostess at this club, your
			Daddy was performing and I had
			never laughed so hard in my life.
			He asked me to come with him.  I
			quit my job and we've been together
			ever since.

Delacroix pulls out his billfold and gives Dot five crisp
new model hundred dollar bills.

				DELACROIX
			Don't tell him it's from me or he
			won't take it.

				DOT
			Your father is proud of you.

										  76.


				DELACROIX
			He never showed it.

				DOT
			He did the best way he knew how,
			Junebug is stubborn just like you.

Delacroix kisses his sleeping father of the forehead.

				DOT (CONT'D)
			I'll take care of him.

EXT. I-95 NORTH - NIGHT

Delacroix is driving back home - up North.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			My Daddy.  I'm not mad at him.  Not
			at all.  Junebug was the reason I
			got into this business in the first
			place.

CLOSER

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			And I thank him for that.  However,
			it did me no good seeing him in
			that state.  Daddy was a broken man.
			He had been a strong man, with
			conviction, integrity, principles
			and look where it had gotten him.
			I had to ask myself did I want to
			end up where he was?

OVERHEAD REAR VIEW MIRROR

Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself, and
SPEAK TO US.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			That was the last time I ever saw
			my father.

The audience goes crazy as the curtain goes up and the house
band kicks in with the Mantan theme.

ON STAGE

The setting is a chicken coop, live roosters and chickens
move freely about Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat.  They start right
into their routine at a furious pace.

				MANTAN

			Get her one of dose...

				MANTAN
			...to big.  The in-between one, not

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			That'll work.  I just bought one
			for myself.

Mantan cocks his limp wrist.  The audience ROARS.

				SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D)
			Not for me, my woolly headed cotton
			pickin' friend for...

				MANTAN
			I thought you got rid of...

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			...that was Vicki, her best friend.
			Dat dress will cast ya round...

				MANTAN
			...dat's too much money.  I can't

				MANTAN
			I'll buy her a less expensive
			dress, so I can have some money
			left over to take her out to dinner.

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			We should go out on a double date.

										  81.


				MANTAN

OFF-SCREEN we HEAR the VOICE of MASSA CHARLIE, he's the
overseer of this plantation.

				MASSA CHARLIE (O.S.)
			Who goes in there?

				SLEEP 'N EAT
			We'd better hide.

				MANTAN
			It's dat mean, evil overseer Massa
			Charlie.

They hide behind some boxes.

				MASSA CHARLIE
			I say who goes in there?

				BOTH
			There's nobody in here 'cept us

Massa Charlie enters the chicken coops with a SHOTGUN
blazing.  Sleep 'N Eat and Mantan do a jig as they try to
escape the buckshot.

ON AUDIENCE

They're rolling down the aisles in hysterics.

INT. CONTROL BOOTH

Everyone in the booth is laughing uncontrollably.  Except
Delacroix.  Even Sloan is dying.

				DUNWITTY
			I know all of you have seen the
			overnight ratings.  Through the
			roof.  But in this game you gotta
			be one, two, three steps ahead.  I
			introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb.
			She's the best media consultant in
			the biz.

				MYRNA
			First, I would like to say I love
			the show.  It's very courageous.
			My parents marched in Selma,
			Alabama with Dr. King.

				DELACROIX
			Why are you here?

				MYRNA
			Good question, straight to the
			point.  I like your style.  Because
			of the content of the show we can
			expect some spirited reactions.

				DUNWITTY
			Myrna is here to help us plan our
			strategy.

				MYRNA
			The best defense is offense.

				DELACROIX
			I thought it was the other way
			around.

				MYRNA
			You get my point.  I've mapped out
			some strategies to help bolster our
			position.

				SLOAN
			Which is?

				MYRNA
			That this is fun.  Nice wholesome
			fun.

				DUNWITTY
			Goldfarb, run it down for them.

										  88.


				MYRNA
			The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't
			it?  Number One.  We gainfully

			of and behind the cameras.  Two.
			Let the audience decide.  Three.
			Who put these critics in charge?
			These so-called cultural police?
			Four.  Who determines what is black?
			Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six.
			If they can't take a joke, ""F"" 'em.

				DUNWITTY
			We all stick to this, it's smooth
			sailing.

				SLOAN
			It sounds kinda simplistic to me.

				MYRNA
			I've done my research.

				DELACROIX
			These are black folks we're talkin'
			about, not some lab mice in a cage.

				MYRNA
			Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in
			African-American studies from Yale,
			so I do feel I'm qualified.

				DUNWITTY
			Let Myrna finish.

				MYRNA
			Thank you.  And always smile.

				DELACROIX
			Yeah, show dem pearly whites.

She ignores him.

				MYRNA
			Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name
			of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the
			word ""community"" often when talking
			about Mantan.  And finally our
			biggest plus is you, Pierre
			Delacroix.

				DELACROIX
			Me?

										  89.


				DUNWITTY
			Yes you!

				MYRNA
			This show was created, conceived by
			you, a non-threatening African-
			American male.  Voila.  End of
			argument.  It can't be racist
			because you're black.

				DELACROIX
			I'm not black.  I'm a NEGRO!!!

INT. CNS HALLWAY - POST MEETING

Sloan and Delacroix are walking in the hallway.  They keep
getting interrupted by people who congratulate Delacroix on
the success of the show.

				SLOAN
			So you have your small victory, now
			what?

				DELACROIX
			A small victory isn't that small
			when you've been use to losing.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - MORNING

Sloan hands Delacroix a wrapped gift.

				DELACROIX
			What is this?

				SLOAN
			A gift.

				DELACROIX
			For what?

				SLOAN
			No matter what you think, you did
			come up with something unique.
			Open it.

Delacroix opens his gift.  It is one of those old cast iron
Black Collectibles.  This one is called ""THE JOLLY NIGGER
BANK,"" a head of a Negro, big lips, big nose, wide eyes.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Put a coin in the hand.

He puts a quarter in the hand.

										  90.


				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Watch this.

She pushes the lever and the mouth opens, the quarter flies
in and his eyes go to the top of his head.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Read it on the back.

Delacroix reads.

				DELACROIX
			The Jolly Nigger Bank.

				SLOAN
			This is authentic, not a repro,
			circa turn of the century.

				DELACROIX
			Thanks.

				SLOAN
			I thought it was appropiate.

				DELACROIX
			Is that good or bad?

				SLOAN
			It's all good.  You got a hit show,
			you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I
			love these old black collectibles.

				DELACROIX
			How so?

				SLOAN
			To me, it shows part of our history
			in this country, a time when we
			were considered inferior, sub-human.

CLOSE ON JOLLY NIGGER BANK

Delacroix puts another quarter in the hand and flips the
lever.  The quarter flies into his mouth as his eyes roll to
the top of his head.

INT. WLIB - DAY

Delacroix is a guest on the GARY BYRD show.  WLIB is the
number one black talk radio station in the nation.

										  91.


				GARY BYRD
			Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix.
			He is the creator of the highly
			controversial TV show MANTAN.
			Let's get right into it.  You have
			been called by some in the community
			a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.
			Why does your show generate such
			feelings?

				DELACROIX
			Because race has always been a
			sensitive issue in this country.
			Gary, I have no problem with people
			disagreeing with the show, it's
			when folks start trying to mess
			with my inherent right as an
			artist, that's when I get mad.  No
			one, in any way, shape or form
			should be censored.

				GARY BYRD
			No matter how sexist or racist the
			material may be?

				DELACROIX
			Yes.  And I say yes because who is
			to judge?  Who is to stand before
			us and say this is righteous and
			this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

				GARY BYRD
			But the line has to be drawn.

				DELACROIX
			Don't you people get it?  We're in
			the 21st Century.  Slavery was over
			four hundred years ago.  All that
			stuff people talked in the old
			days, it's over.  Folks always
			crying, white man this, white man
			that.  Let's all grow up.

				GARY BYRD
			Are you trying to excuse our
			Holocaust?

				DELACROIX
			Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a
			great Aunt, we called her Sister.
			She went to her grave not believing
			man had walked on the Moon.
				(MORE)

										  92.


				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			When I was a little kid, I would
			argue with her, ""it's on TV.""  She
			would answer ""I don't care what's
			on that idiot box.  No MAN is on
			the MOON.""  Well, there are a lot
			of your Negroes just like my Aunt
			Sister.  Face up to it.  The world
			has changed and if you don't adapt,
			change with it, you will be left
			behind.  This show is a parody.
			Are you telling me that nobody can
			use some humor, have some laughs in
			their lives?  Is that what you're
			telling me?

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Mantan opens it.  He pulls out an old pair of tap shoes.

			Gots no intention of ending up broke.

				SLOAN
			Y'know, at the beginnin' of the

				MANTAN
			No, before my time.

				SLOAN
			You don't read, do you?

				MANTAN
			Never read a book in my whole life.

				SLOAN
			Maybe you need to start.

				MANTAN
			Maybe I need to do a lot of things.

				SLOAN
			Bert Williams and the rest, they
			had to black up.  They had no

			know that's written in the
			Constitution of the United States?

										  98.


				MANTAN
			Why all of a sudden are you flippin'

			part of the deal from the git-go.

			Well, I'll be an Alabama porch

			visited us often, fell in love with
			my stepdaughter and married her.
			Thusly he became my son-in-law and
			my stepdaughter became my mother
			because she was my father's wife.
			Soon after dis my wife gave birth
			to a son, which of course was my
			father's brother in-law and my
			uncle, for he was the brother of my
			step-mother.  My father's wife also
			became the mother of a son.  He was
			of course my brother and also my
			grandchild for he was the son of my
			daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was
			my grandmother because she was my
			mother's mother.

Delacroix jumps out og his chair and starts sobbing.  Two
ushers have to help him to the stage.  He is overcome with
emotion.  The audience is on their feet with a standing
ovation.  He hugs Alec Baldwin.

				DELACROIX
			Alec Baldwin, this is the very

Mantan is moving and grooving.  The unrest in the audience
has picked up.

ON AUDIENCE

They start to ""boo.""  The tide has turned.  Encouraged, the
Mau-Mau's pick it up another notch.

ON MANTAN

He's human after all, and he does hear the boos.  Don't let
those athletes in the papers fool you.  You hear the boos
and nobody, nobody except Dennis Rodman likes to be booed.
Mantan is getting rattled.

ON MAU-MAU'S BOX

Sloan rushes into the box and they are quiet.  They don't
have to say or shout a thing.  The rough Apollo crowd is
doing it all themselves.

TWO SHOT ON SLOAN AND BIG BLACK

The sister and big brother look at each other.  There is no
love between them.

				SLOAN
			This doesn't change a thing.  I
			will still love him.

Big Black can't believe what he has just heard.

ON STAGE

Now projectiles are raining down upon Mantan.  This has
turned into a RUCKUS, a BROUHAHA, a DONNYBROOK.  Honeycutt
races onto the stage to pull off the still tap dancing
Mantan as the Harlem natives BUMRUSH the stage.  THE WORM
HAS TURNED.

			Yeah.

				DELACROIX
			And now is definitely not the time

EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT

Delacroix speeds away.

INT. BET STUDIO - NIGHT

Mantan is on the BET show with host TAVIS SMILEY.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			Our guest tonight is the
			extraordinary, talented performer,
			Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.

				MANTAN
			Tavis, thank you for having me.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			Before we begin, I want to thank
			you for coming on my show for your
			first television interview.  You
			could have chosen Mike Wallace,
			Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley,
			whatnot but you're here.

				MANTAN
			I'm more comfortable around my
			people.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			Let's jump right into it.  Your
			show has sparked a world of
			controversy, provoked a tone of
			dialogue.  How do you see all of
			this?

				MANTAN
			Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is
			the two-one, the 21st century and
			it's all about the money.  Like my
			man Mase says, ""it's all about the
			Benjamins.""

										 110.


				TAVIS SMILEY
			Money and nothing else?

				MANTAN
			Money makes the world go round.  It
			ain't no joke being poor.  I know
			whatI'mtalkin''bout.
			Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on
			the street.  I've been homeless.
			I've learned how to play the game,
			work the game, be in the game.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			Is it inevitable that the game
			plays you?

				MANTAN
			No if you go with the flow, Tavis.
			That's what a lot of Negroes don't
			understand.  Protesting isn't gonna
			do a damn thing.  If people don't
			like our satire in our number one
			hit show then don't watch it.  Or
			better yet write your own show.  Do
			it better.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			Don't you feel that is a simplistic
			retort?

				MANTAN
			I don't know what a retort is, but
			it's simple.  Mantan - The New
			Millennium Minstrel Show is
			UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for
			Negroes in Compton or 125th in
			Harlem.  This is America.  Our
			ancestors helped build this country,
			we got a right, just like everybody
			else.  I'm not gonna box myself in.
			This show makes people think, and
			they're laughing at the same time.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			I admit, that's a very hard thing
			to do.  Quickly let's go to the
			phones before we pay the bills and
			hear from our proud sponsors, DA
			BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT
			LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA
			FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER.
			125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN
			YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.
				(MORE)

										 111.


				TAVIS SMILEY (CONT'D)
			Our first caller is Big Black from
			Brooklyn.  Go 'head.

ON MANTAN

				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			Microphone check, one, two.  One,
			two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show
			but Mantan you is foul.  Why you
			perpetrating?  You a sellout.

				MANTAN
			That's our opinion.

				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			You're a traitor to the race.  A
			tool for the Caucasoids.

				MANTAN
			Why?  Because I'm successful?
			Because I don't use ""Causcasoids""
			as an excuse for not fulfilling my
			dreams?

				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			I ain't hearing all dat noise.  You
			getting played and you don't even
			know it.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			And Big Black from Brooklyn, what
			do you do?

				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			What do I do?

				TAVIS SMILEY
			What do you do?

				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			I'm a revolutionary.

				MANTAN
			That's a job?

				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			That's a full time job, especially
			when sellouts like you are running
			around, acting insane.

				TAVIS SMILEY
			That's enough.

										 112.


				BIG BLACK (O.S.)
			And another thing, you better stay
			away from my sister or you better...

CLICK!!!

				TAVIS SMILEY
			Ladies and gentlemen, there is no
			need to go there.  We can all agree
			to disagree without making threats.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sloan turns off the TV.

				DELACROIX
			Why'd you do that?

				SLOAN
			I don't want to hear it.

				DELACROIX
			How long have you and Hambone been
			hangin' out?

				SLOAN
			You're the one that put us together.
			We're friends.

				DELACROIX
			That crazy brother of yours doesn't
			think so.

				SLOAN
			He's just playing big brother.

				DELACROIX
			Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with
			Mantan?

				SLOAN
			Please don't go there.

				DELACROIX
			Dunwitty and I feel you've been
			getting too close to him, getting
			his mind all messed up.

				SLOAN
			I can't lie to him.  If he asks me
			something, I tell him what I think.

				DELACROIX
			Do you have to be so damn forthright?

										 113.


				SLOAN
			DeLa, you should try it sometime.
			Come into the light.

				DELACROIX
			Light?

				SLOAN
			That which has been hidden in
			darkness is now in the light.  This
			bucket of blood.

				DELACROIX
			You can talk all that mumbo jumbo
			if you want to but your hands are
			much bloody.  I know where I made
			my big mistake.  I have a general
			rule, never get involved
			romantically with somebody crazier
			than you.

CUT TO FLASHBACK

INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Delacroix and Sloan are taking off their clothes.

				DELACROIX
			This is crazy.

				SLOAN
			That's why it will be so much fun.

They kiss, fall half undressed upon the motel bed.

								  CUT BACK TO:

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

				SLOAN
			That was a mistake, but I don't
			regret it.

				DELACROIX
			The first and only time.  A big
			mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you
			not to see Mantan anymore.

				SLOAN
			Work related or otherwise?

										 114.


				DELACROIX
			Otherwise.  I trust you know the
			difference.  You're an intelligent
			woman, finished at NYU.

				SLOAN
			DeLa, kiss my big black ass.

				DELACROIX
			And that's how you got me in the
			first place.

Sloan pulls a 3/4 inch cassette out of her bag and hands it
to him.

				SLOAN
			I want you to please view this.  It
			may save your Life.

INT. MANTAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mantan and Delacroix are in the middle of a heated discussion.

				DELACROIX
			You shouldn't even be mad at me
			over Sloan.

				MANTAN
			What you did is dead wrong.

				DELACROIX
			Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this
			business if people don't produce,
			they get fired.

				MANTAN
			Sloan is the hardest working person
			I've ever met.

				DELACROIX
			Let me ask you a question, if I may.
			How do you think she got the job in
			the first place?  I don't mean to
			burst your bubble, Mantan the
			Marvelous, but Sloan is an
			opportunity.

				MANTAN
			I don't believe it.

				DELACROIX
			Do I have to spell it out for you?
			In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.

										 115.


INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

Mantan is grilling Sloan.

				MANTAN
			How did you get this gig?

				SLOAN
			Worked my black ass off, first as
			an intern, then worked my way up to
			this position.

				MANTAN
			You leave something out?

				SLOAN
			After my internship expired, Dela
			was impressed and offered me a
			position as his assistant.

				MANTAN
			And?

				SLOAN
			And what?

				MANTAN
			Stop playing me Sloan.

				SLOAN
			Just ask me what you want to know.

				MANTAN
			Oh, you gonna make me say it.

				SLOAN
			Say what, Manray?

				MANTAN
			Did you ever sleep with DeLa?

				SLOAN
			We did it one time, only once.  It
			had nothing to do with the job, it
			was stupid.  Everything I've got
			I've earned.

				MANTAN
			Aw, c'mon.

				SLOAN
			That's ancient history.  That has
			nothing to do with you and I.

										 116.


				MANTAN
			So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna
			use me up just like you used Dela?
			Work it to the top.  I never
			imagined people in this biz could
			flip on you like ""IHOP.""  I'm damn
			happy DeLa fired ya ass.

				SLOAN
			Forget about me, are you a puppet
			for DeLa?

				MANTAN
			Don't try to change to the subject.

				SLOAN
			Why don't you answer?

				MANTAN
			I know I won't be your puppet.

				SLOAN
			You can go now.

				MANTAN
			I wuz leaving anyway, for good.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

As usual, the clan is smoking and drinking DA BOMB, a thick
marijuana haze hangs over the studio.

				1/16TH BLACK
			Yo, I got da bomb plan.  We gonna
			hook homeslice Mantan up nicely.

He holds up a floppy disk.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Delacroix sits behind the desk.  He's bought even more Black
Collectibles, he's surrounded by them.

ON DELACROIX

He dials the phone.

				DELACROIX
			Hello, Mommy, how are you?

										 117.


				ORCHID (O.S.)
			I'm doing okay.  Been reading about
			your show, it's all over everywhere.
			I watched it's all over everywhere.
			I watched it once.  I thought you
			said there would be no buffoonery.

				DELACROIX
			You going to attack me too.  The
			show is a hit.  Aren't you happy
			for me?

INT. ORCHID'S HOUSE

				ORCHID
			Of course I'm happy for you.
			You've worked very hard for your
			success.

				DELACROIX (O.S.)
			Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy
			called?

				ORCHID
			No.

ON DELACROIX

				DELACROIX
			Not at all?

				ORCHID (O.S.)
			You know how your Daddy is.

				DELACROIX
			If and when he calls, please don't
			forget to ask him if he's seen
			Mantan.

				ORCHID (O.S.)
			I won't forget.  When are you
			coming up here to see your mother?

				DELACROIX
			Soon.

Delacroix hangs up the phone.  He takes out some change from
his pocket and puts a quarter in the hand of his Jolly
Nigger Bank.

TIGHT ON JNB

Delacroix flips the lever and the quarter flies into the
MOUTH as the EYES roll to the top of its HEAD.

										 118.


Delacroix does this several times.  CLOSEUPS of the BLACK
COLLECTIBLES in the office.

CLOSER ON JNB

Delacroix is staring at the JNB when its MOUTH OPENS, a
quarter flies in and its EYES roll to the top of its HEAD.

ON DELACROIX

He is incredulous.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			When I thought or imagined that my
			favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an
			inanimate object, a piece of cold,
			cast iron, was moving by itself...

Delacroix slowly, carefully approaches the bank and picks it
off the table.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			...I knew I was getting paranoid.
			Did I really see what I saw or was
			I buggin'?

ON JNB

It's stopped moving.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Honeycutt is warming up the crazed ""Black Face""-wearing
audience.  He points to a YOUNG WHITE MALE, BOBBY

				HONEYCUTT

WHITE LADY, LOUISE, a senior citizen.

				HONEYCUTT
			Ma'am, is you a nigga?

				LOUISE

Dunwitty looks at him.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Delacroix is met by BUNNING, the STAGE MANAGER.

				BUNNING
			You better talk to him.  He won't
			listen to me.

Delacroix walks over to Mantan who stands in a corner.

				DELACROIX
			Mantan, we got a show to tape.

				MANTAN
			My name is Manray, goddamnit.

				DELACROIX
			Kook and the Gang, it's Manray.
			Let's do the taping.  You go back

			and blacken up.

				MANRAY
			I'm not playin' myself no mo'.

				DELACROIX
			How you sound?

				MANRAY
			I won't do it anymore.

				DELACROIX
			Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy
			Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it
			gave me no joy pulling ya coattail
			about her, just lookin' out for a
			brother.  I feel you, all this
			stuff happenin' at once but you
			can't let if affect your work.  You
			gotta be professional.

				MANRAY
			I'm always gonna be that.  But I
			ain't doing no more buck dancing.

				DELACROIX
			No costume.  No blackface.

										 121.


				MANRAY
			No.  No.

Manray leads the way to the stage.

				BUNNING
			I should notify Dunwitty.

				DELACROIX
			And I should put my foot dead up in
			yo' ass.

				BUNNING
			I won't be held responsible.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Honeycutt stands in front of the drawn curtain.

				HONEYCUTT
			We apologize for the holdup but
			without further delay, ladies and
			gentlemen, boys and girls, let's
			give it up for Mantan.

A THUNDEROUS ROAR FROM THE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

				HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)
			C'mon, don't be niggardly, give it
			up.  Show Mantan some love.

The CURTAIN RISES and MANRAY stands before them in his
regular street clothes and NO BLACK FACE.

ON AUDIENCE

The THUNDEROUS ROAR is CUT OFF LIKE the LIGHTS, LIKE CON
EDISON PULLS THE PLUG WHEN YOU DON'T PAY THE BILL.

INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

Dunwitty is HYSTERICAL.

				DUNWITTY

			you can muster up inside your
			assaulted, bruised amd battered
			bodies.

ON MANRAY

				MANRAY

He collapses onto the stage and the AUDIENCE sits on their
hands.  Manray gets up and begins to dance.

ON STAGE

Dunwitty runs to Bunning.

				DUNWITTY
			Drop the curtain.  Drop the curtain.

Bunning drops the curtain.  Security rushes onto the stage
and grabs Manray.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			Escort him out the building now!

				MANRAY
			I wasn't finished doing my dance.

				DUNWITTY
			But you are finished.  Done.
			Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen.
			I'm gonna slide Honeycutt right
			into ya spot.  We won't miss a step.
			Get him outta here.

The security guards move Manray as Dunitty glares at
Delacroix.  Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to
the top.

				DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
			DeLa, I'll deal with you next.

										 123.


EXT. BACKSTAGE

The security guards toss Manray out the stage door.  Manray
looks down the alley and it's empty except for a parked SUV.
He picks himself up and does a joyous dance.  This is
Manray's dance of Freedom.

ON STREET

The Big Black Chevy Suburban creeps down the alley to a
dancing Manray and comes to rest right in front of him.
Manray tries to shield his eyes from the hi-beam headlights.

				MANRAY
			Whaddup?

No one comes out.

				MANRAY (CONT'D)
			Whaddup?

The doors open and the Mau-Mau's file out.

				BIG BLACK
			You truly are a dancing fool.

				1/16TH BLACK
			Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

				MANRAY
			Don't start none, won't be none.

The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.  Manray tries to walk
through them.  They block him.  Manray attempts to climb
over the suburban.  He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole
Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle.

EXT. EMPTY BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

The Mau-Mau Mobile rolls up to an abandoned factory.

ON CHEVY SUBURBAN

The Mau-Mau's quickly carry Manray out from the back of the
vehicle into the factory.

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

Manray sits, feet and hands tied, in the middle of a
cavernous space.  A digital video camera stands on a tripod
in front of him.

				BIG BLACK
			You is one dead nigger.

										 124.


				MANRAY
			What did I do?

				BIG BLACK
			What did you do?

The Mau-Mau's laugh.

				BIG BLACK (CONT'D)
			Brothers, he asks what did he do?

				DOUBLE BLACK
			If you don't know there is nuthin'
			we can do for you.

				BIG BLACK
			Nigga, you will be executed.

ON MANRAY

His face says he can't believe this is happening.

				MANRAY
			For singing and dancing?

				1/16TH BLACK
			You will be done in front of the
			world.

				MO BLACK
			The whole world will be watching.

				1/16TH BLACK
			Via the internet.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			The Mau-Mau's had come up with a
			brilliant, sadistic plan to
			broadcast Mantan's execution LIVE
			over the internet.

				1/16TH BLACK
			We have pirated broadcasting
			facilities.  No way we can be found
			out.  We're in cyberspace.

				JO BLACK

			late.

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Delacroix and Cheeba are being interrogated in two adjoining
spaces.  WE ARE seeing them through the two-way mirrors.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			It's no joke getting grilled by the

Delacroix SCREAMS.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			I don't know anything.

				FBI AGENT
			We know you're involved in this
			abduction.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

				CHEEBA
			You know more than me.  Why would I

				FBI AGENT #2
			You tell us.

EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

It's a mob scene as the media frenzy heightens.  Delacroix
and Cheeba try to fight their way through the print and
broadcast journalists trying to question them as they leave
FBI headquarters.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			Somehow, someway, somebody had
			tipped the sharks off.  It was a
			feeding frenzy.

Delacroix and Cheeba start pushing people out of the way as
they get in to their waiting car.

										 126.


INT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM - NIGHT

There is a flurry of activity - people man phones, computers
all HI-TECH.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)

				SLOAN
			A what?

				BARNETT
			It's used to mask the origin of an

			it's sent.

				DELACROIX
			There oughta be a law...

				BARNETT
			Not yet, anyway, it's legal.  We

apartments, projects, hi-tech computer labs looking for the
Mau-Mau's.

				DELACROIX (V.O.)
			SWAT teams all up and down the East

			looking for Manray.  All the tips
			called in, info gathered through
			surveillance proved for naught.

INT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM

				BARNETT
			The both of you should go home.  We
			will keep you abreast.

				SLOAN
			This is looking like a needle in a

				DELACROIX
			Thank you for your help.

				BARNETT
			The X-Force always gets their man.

ON MONITOR

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			Since a lot of people still didn't

			It was granted.  A life snuff
			broadcast right into your living
			room.

ON DELACROIX

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			I had to give it to the Mau-Mau',
			they definitely had a sense of

			as the website to pirate.

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

The Mau-Mau's ironically wear WHITE MASKS, they stand behind
the tied-up Mantan.  A device alters their voices.

				BIG BLACK

Manray.  They scream ""Faster!"" and ""Dance!"" Manray is
hoofing.  He's never tapped this fast, at this breakneck
pace, ever.  But it's evident his dance is one of defiance.
He's not dancing to stay alive.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He screams at the monitor.

				DELACROIX
			Don't dance.  Don't do it.

INT. FACTORY

The Mau-Mau's have noticed Manray's strong will, his pride
and they don't like it.  They shoot even more at his feet.

				BIG BLACK
			You ain't Blak.

				DOUBLE BLACK
			Blak you ain't.

										 131.


				SMOOTH BLACK
			You a Oreo.  Not Blak.  Not BLAK.

The Mau-Mau's start to chant, ""Blak, blak, blak.""

INT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT

She hears this and quickly picks up the phone to call the
authorities.

INT. FACTORY

				MANRAY
			There is nothing you can do to me.
			I'm wearing the taps of Bill
			""Bojangles"" Robinson.

Manray is shot in one foot.  Then the other.

				BIG BLACK
			Let's seeya dance now, Mr. Bojangles.

Manray somehow manages to right himself and starts to dance
again.  The Mau-Mau's can't believe it.

ON MANRAY

He dances like his life depends on it.  Despite the fact his
feet are a bloody mess.

				BIG BLACK (CONT'D)
			You ain' BLAK.

He shoots Manray in the chest, the Mau-Mau's follow him and
he does a spastic last jig as the 9mm bullets riddle his
twitching body.

ON TV SCREEN

It goes black.

MONTAGE

Helicopters fly through the night sky.  Cop cars and trucks,
SWAT team vehicles are on the move.  SIRENS BLARE.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE

Delacroix's head is on his desk.  He has been crying.  On
cue the Black Collectibles start to move.  The Jolly Nigger
Bank, Aunt Jemima's, Mammies, etc., they are animated for
REAL.

										 132.


ON DELACROIX

His head pops up as he sees the objects.  He too is in
BLACKFACE.  In a rage, he starts to throw them against the
wall.

				DELACROIX
			Leave me alone.  Get away from me.
			You spearchucker.  You black sambo.
			You nigger pickaninny.  Fat Mammie.

Delacroix has finally lost it.  He looks at the shambles
he's made of his office.

EXT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

The Mau-Mau's come out of the factory high as a kite.  Each
has a big fat joint or a 64 oz. of DA BOMB.  They're also
doing a free-style rap about their execution.

ON CHEVY SUBURBAN

They get in when the squak of police walkie-talkie's clicks.

				BIG BLACK
			It's the man!

What follows is a horrifying display of firepower.  All the
Mau-Mau's bodies are doing the Bonnie and Clyde Sonny
Corleone Dance of Death as bullets tear into them and the
Suburban.  Not one of them is able to get a shot off.  The
shooting stops.  The twitching stops.  All's quiet.  1/16th
Black comes out with his hands up.

				1/16TH BLACK
			Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I've
			been held hostage.  They made me
			part of them against my own free
			will.  Don't shoot!

The cops quickly pounce on 1/16th Black.

				1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D)
			I'm WHITE.  I'm WHITE!  Look at me,
			I'm white!

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE

Delacroix is on the floor when the doorknob turns.  It's
Sloan and she has a gun in one hand and her inhaler in the
other.  She's wheezing like mad.

				SLOAN
			Get up and put that tape in.

										 133.


She points the gun at his head.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Do what I say.

Delacroix takes the cassette tape off his desk and puts it
in the 3/4 inch desk.

				SLOAN (CONT'D)
			Don't make me have to use this.

				DELACROIX
			I didn't think this was in your
			studies at NYU.

Delacroix hits the PLAY button.

ON SCREEN

IMAGES.  HISTORY.  VISUALS.  Sloan has put together a tape
of the worst, most racist, stereotypical images from cinema
and TV over the last 100 years.  With these images there's
also a laugh-track.

				SLOAN
			Watch this.  This is what you
			contributed to.  Because of you,
			Manray is dead.  Mu brother's dead.
			It's all because of you.

Delacroix can't watch the monitor.

				DELACROIX
			I'm sorry.  I didn't know anyone
			would get hurt.  I'm sorry, please
			give me that gun before you hurt
			yourself.  Give me the gun.

He reaches for it.  BOOM!  Sloan screams.

				SLOAN
			I told you but you wouldn't listen.
			You never listened to me.

				DELACROIX
			Give me the gun.

She reluctantly hands it to him.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			Go, get out of here.  Go home.

Sloan runs out.  Delacroix slumps to the floor, WIPES HER
FINGERPRINTS off the revolver.

										 134.


ON DELACROIX

He looks at the monitor, the tape still playing.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			As I bled to death, as my very
			precious life oozed out of me all I
			could think of was that I never
			made my father proud.  My mother
			didn't count.

ON SCREEN

We see STEP 'N FETCHIT, MANTAN MORELAND and WILLIE BEST.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			Everything I did, no matter how
			great or small, was always
			extraordinary to her.  With Daddy
			it was a different ball game.  He
			never saw me.  Pierre Delacroix.

ON DELACROIX

A pool of blood has formed around his dying body.

				DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
			Now it was time to buy the farm,
			for me to meet my maker.  Goodbye
			cousins, and please tune in next
			week for the Best of Mantan - The
			New Millennium Minstrel Show.

ON SCREEN

We see MANTAN in BLACKFACE doing his BUCKDANCE

CLOSE ON DELACROIX

He looks at Mantan.

				DELACROIX (CONT'D)
			For the love of Joseph and Mary,
			what have I done?  My God, what
			have I done?!

Delacroix slumps over dead.

			THE BIG LEBOWSKI

We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
gently singing ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and a deep, affable, 
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

				VOICE-OVER
		A way out west there was a fella, 
		fella I want to tell you about, fella 
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
		least, that was the handle his lovin' 
		parents gave him, but he never had 
		much use for it himself.  This 
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
		self-apply where I come from.  But 
		then, there was a lot about the Dude 
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
		to me.  And a lot about where he 
		lived, like- wise.  But then again, 
		maybe that's why I found the place 
		s'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at 
twilight stretches out before us.

				VOICE-OVER
		They call Los Angeles the City of 
		Angels.  I didn't find it to be that 
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are 
		some nice folks there.  'Course, I 
		can't say I seen London, and I never 
		been to France, and I ain't never 
		seen no queen in her damn undies as 
		the fella says.  But I'll tell you 
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and 
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
		a those other places, and in English 
		too, so I can die with a smile on my 
		face without feelin' like the good 
		Lord gypped me.

INTERIOR   RALPH'S

It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking 
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the 
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed 
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their 
expiration dates.

				VOICE-OVER
		Now this story I'm about to unfold 
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict 
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I 
		only mention it 'cause some- times 
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
		there's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of 
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

				VOICE-OVER
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
		sometimes there's a man who, wal, 
		he's the man for his time'n place, 
		he fits right in there--and that's 
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.

CHECKOUT GIRL

She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to 
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with 
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

				GEORGE BUSH
		This aggression will not stand. . . 
		This will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at 
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

				VOICE-OVER
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
		the Dude was certainly that--quite 
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
		County.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and 
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

				VOICE-OVER
		...which would place him high in the 
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
		there's a man.

EXTERIOR  RALPH'S

Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or 
three cars parked in the huge lot.

				VOICE-OVER
		Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.  
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced him 
		enough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and 
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S HOUSE

The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow 
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small 
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the 
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

INSIDE

The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, 
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece 
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a 
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small 
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of 
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper 
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet 
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the 
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

				VOICE
		We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny 
		said you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and 
gasps for air.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

				VOICE
		WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

				DUDE
		It's uh, it's down there somewhere.  
		Lemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

				VOICE
		Don't fuck with us.  If your wife 
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that 
		means you owe money to Jackie 
		Treehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and 
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against 
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly 
and walks over to a rug.

				CHINESE MAN
		Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his 
sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Oh, man.  Don't do--

				BLOND MAN
		You see what happens?  You see what 
		happens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You 
		got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, 
		man.

				BLOND MAN
		Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is 
		Bunny.

				DUDE
		Bunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

				DUDE
		You see a wedding ring?  Does this 
		place look like I'm fucking married?   
		All my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a 
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious 
native.

				BLOND MAN
		The fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights 
it.

				DUDE
		Obviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

				BLOND MAN
		Woo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

				WOO
		Yeah?

				BLOND MAN
		Wasn't this guy supposed to be a 
		millionaire?

				WOO
		Uh?

They both look around.

				WOO
		Fuck.

				BLOND MAN
		What do you think?

				WOO
		He looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger 
and peeks over them.

				DUDE
		Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

				WOO
		Fuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

				BLOND MAN
		Thanks a lot, asshole.

						 ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins 
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, 
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a 
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant 
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail 
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

				MAN
		Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  
		Mark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man 
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried 
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves 
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He 
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he 
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears 
some of its foam on his mustache.

				WALTER
		This was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

				WALTER
		This was, uh--

				DUDE
		Yeah man, it really tied the room 
		together--

				WALTER
		This was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

				DONNY
		What tied the room together, Dude?

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the story, 
		Donny?

				DONNY
		What--

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the Dude's 
		story?

				DONNY
		I was bowling--

				WALTER
		So you have no frame of reference, 
		Donny.  You're like a child who 
		wanders in in the middle of a movie 
		and wants to know--

				DUDE
		What's your point, Walter?

				WALTER
		There's no fucking reason--here's my 
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

				DONNY
		Yeah Walter, what's your point?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		What's the point of--we all know who 
		was at fault, so what the fuck are 
		you talking about?

				WALTER
		Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you 
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about 
		unchecked aggression here--

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				DUDE
		My rug.

				WALTER
		Forget it, Donny.  You're out of 
		your element.

				DUDE
		This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I 
		can't go give him a bill so what the 
		fuck are you talking about?

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?!  
		This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm 
		talking about drawing a line in the 
		sand, Dude.  Across this line you do 
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is 
		not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- 
		American.  Please.

				DUDE
		Walter, this is not a guy who built 
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy 
		who peed on my--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you--

				DUDE
		Walter, he peed on my rug--

				DONNY
		He peed on the Dude's rug--

				WALTER
		YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This 
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

				DUDE
		So who--

				WALTER
		Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other 
		Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.  
		He's gonna be easier to find anyway 
		than these two, uh. these two  . . . 
		And he has the wealth, uh, the 
		resources obviously, and there is no 
		reason, no FUCKING reason, why his 
		wife should go out and owe money and 
		they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		No, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Okay. That, uh.

He elaborately clears his throat.

That rap really tied the room together, did it not?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				DONNY
		And this guy peed on it.

				WALTER
		Donny!  Please!

				DUDE
		Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

				DONNY
		His name is Lebowski?  That's your 
		name, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should 
		compensate me for the fucking rug.  
		I mean his wife goes out and owes 
		money and they pee on my rug.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on 
		your fucking Rug.

CLOSE ON A PLAQUE

We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver 
to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, 
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room 
with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:

				YOUNG MAN
		And this is the study.  You can see 
		the various commendations, honorary 
		degrees, et cetera.

				DUDE
		Yes, uh, very impressive.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please, feel free to inspect them.

				DUDE
		I'm not really, uh.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please!  Please!

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and

certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:

				YOUNG MAN
		That's the key to the city of 
		Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was 
		given two years ago in recognition 
		of his various civic, uh.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				YOUNG MAN
		That's a Los Angeles Chamber of 
		Commerce Business Achiever award, 
		which is given--not necessarily given 
		every year!  Given only when there's 
		a worthy, somebody especially--

				DUDE
		Hey, is this him with Nancy?

				YOUNG MAN
		That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the 
		first lady, yes, taken when--

				DUDE
		Lebowski on the right?

				YOUNG MAN
		Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, 
		Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

				DUDE
		He's handicapped, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And 
		this picture was taken when Mrs. 
		Reagan was first lady of the nation, 
		yes, yes? Not of California.

				DUDE
		Far out.

				YOUNG MAN
		And in fact he met privately with 
		the President, though unfortunately 
		there wasn't time for a photo 
		opportunity.

				DUDE
		Nancy's pretty good.

				YOUNG MAN
		Wonderful woman.  We were very--

				DUDE
		Are these.

				YOUNG MAN
		These are Mr. Lebowski's children, 
		so to speak--

				DUDE
		Different mothers, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		No, they--

				DUDE
		I guess he's pretty, uh, racially 
		pretty cool--

				YOUNG MAN
		They're not his, heh-heh, they're 
		not literally his children; they're 
		the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		inner-city children of promise but 
		without the--

				DUDE
		I see.

				YOUNG MAN
		--without  the means  for higher  
		education, so Mr. Lebowski  has 
		committed  to sending  all of them 
		to college.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  Think he's got room for one 
		more?

				YOUNG MAN
		One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went 
		to college?

				DUDE
		Well, yeah I did, but I spent most 
		of my time occupying various, um, 
		administration buildings--

				YOUNG MAN
		Heh-heh--

				DUDE
		--smoking thai-stick, breaking into 
		the ROTC--

				YOUNG MAN
		Yes, heh--

				DUDE
		--and bowling.  I'll tell you the 
		truth, Brandt, I don't remember most 
		of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed 
Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI 
ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we 
realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the 
display is mirrored.

We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, 
wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.

So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He 
wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.

Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized 
wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

				LEBOWSKI
		Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a 
		Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very 
		busy so what can I do for you?

He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him 
as Brandt withdraws.

				DUDE
		Well sir, it's this rug I have, really 
		tied the room together-

				LEBOWSKI
		You told Brandt on the phone, he 
		told me.  So where do I fit in?

				DUDE
		Well they were looking for you, these 
		two guys, they were trying to--

				LEBOWSKI
		I'll say it again, all right?  You 
		told Brandt.  He told me.  I know 
		what happened. Yes?  Yes?

				DUDE
		So you know they were trying to piss 
		on your rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		You mean, did you personally come 
		and pee on my--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla 
		usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.  
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		Well no, like I said, Woo peed on 
		the rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I 
		just want to understand this, sir--
		every time a rug is micturated upon 
		in this fair city, I have to 
		compensate the--

				DUDE
		Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam 
		anybody here, I'm just--

				LEBOWSKI
		You're just looking for a handout 
		like every other--are you employed, 
		Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Look, let me explain something.   
		I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. 
		Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  
		what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. 
		His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  
		you know, you're not into the whole 
		brevity thing--

				LEBOWSKI
		Are you employed, sir?

				DUDE
		Employed?

				LEBOWSKI
		You don't go out and make a living 
		dressed like that in the middle of a 
		weekday.

				DUDE
		Is this a--what day is this?

				LEBOWSKI
		But I do work, so if you don't mind--

				DUDE
		No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.  
		This will not stand, ya know, this 
		will not stand, man.  I mean, if 
		your wife owes--

				LEBOWSKI
		My wife is not the issue here. I 
		hope that my wife will someday learn 
		to live on her allowance, which is 
		ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that 
		will be her problem, not mine, just 
		as your rug is your problem, just as 
		every bum's lot in life is his own 
		responsibility regardless of whom he 
		chooses to blame.  I didn't blame 
		anyone for the loss of my legs, some 
		chinaman in Korea took them from me 
		but I went out and achieved anyway.  
		I can't solve your problems, sir, 
		only you can.

The Dude rises.

				DUDE
		Ah fuck it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!  
		Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your 
		answer to everything!

The Dude is heading for the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		Your ""revolution"" is over, Mr.  
		Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums 
		lost!

As the Dude opens the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		...My advice is, do what your parents 
		did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will 
		always lose-- do you hear me, 
		Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find 
himself--

				HALLWAY
		--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt 
		is approaching.

				BRANDT
		How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Okay.  The old man told me to take 
		any rug in the house.

WALKWAY

A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down 
a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming 
pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.

				BRANDT
		Manolo will load it into your car 
		for you, uh, Dude.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW

Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her 
back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the 
pool.

				BRANDT
		Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see 
		you again some time, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the 
		neighborhood, need to use the john.

CLOSER TRACK

Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the 
nails emerald green.

THE DUDE

Looking.

WIDER

The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early 
twenties.

She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Blow on them.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over 
them.

				DUDE
		Huh?

She waggles her foot and giggles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		G'ahead.  Blow.

The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

				DUDE
		You want me to blow on your toes?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

The Dude looks over at the pool.

				DUDE
		You sure he won't mind?

The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He 
is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He 
wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, 
shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.  
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty 
whiskey bottle bobs.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Dieter doesn't care about anything.  
		He's a nihilist.

				DUDE
		Practicing?

The young woman smiles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		You're not blowing.

Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

				BRANDT
		Our guest has to be getting along, 
		Mrs.  Lebowski.

The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still 
looking at the young woman.

				DUDE
		You're Bunny?

				BUNNY
		I'll suck your cock for a thousand 
		dollars.

Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very 
		free-spirited.  We're all very fond 
		of her.

				BUNNY
		Brandt can't watch though.  Or he 
		has to pay a hundred.

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his

SHOULDER:

				DUDE
		I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

THE BOWLERS

Donny calls out from the bench:

				DONNY
		Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in 
		the water!!

As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to 
another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that 
shares the lane.

				DUDE
		Your maples, Carl.

Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in 
one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.

				WALTER
		Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it 
		is no dream.

				DUDE
		You're fucking twenty minutes late.  
		What the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Theodore Herzel.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		State of Israel.  If you will it, 
		Dude, it is no--

				DUDE
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		The carrier.  What's in the fucking 
		carrier?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		Can't leave him home alone or he 
		eats the furniture.

				DUDE
		What the fuck are you--

				WALTER
		I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		I'm looking after it while Cynthia 
		and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

				DUDE
		You brought a fucking Pomeranian 
		bowling?

				WALTER
		What do you mean ""brought it bowling""?  
		I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not 
		buying it a fucking beer.  He's not 
		gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots 
around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging 
its tail.

				DUDE
		Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked 
		me to take care of her fucking dog 
		while she and her boyfriend went to 
		Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck 
		herself.  Why can't she board it?

				WALTER
		First of all, Dude, you don't have 
		an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show 
		dog with fucking papers.  You can't 
		board it.  It gets upset, its hair 
		falls out.

				DUDE
		Hey man--

				WALTER
		Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over 
		the line!

Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

				WALTER
		Smokey Huh?

				WALTER
		Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.  
		That's a foul.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

				WALTER
		Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit. Walter!

				WALTER
		This is not Nam.  This is bowling.  
		There are rules.

				DUDE
		Come on Walter, it's just--it's 
		Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a 
		little, it's just a game.

				WALTER
		This is a league game.  This 
		determines who enters the next round-
		robin, am I wrong?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the 
		marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an 
		eight.

Walter takes out a gun.

				WALTER
		Smokey my friend, you're entering a 
		world of pain.

				DUDE
		Hey Walter--

				WALTER
		Mark that frame an eight, you're 
		entering a world of pain.

				SMOKEY
		I'm not--

				WALTER
		A world of pain.

A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a 
phone.

				SMOKEY
		Look Dude, I don't hold with this.  
		This guy is your partner, you should--

Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.

				WALTER
		HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM 
		I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT 
		ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!

The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making 
high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

				DUDE
		Walter, they're calling the cops, 
		put the piece away.

				WALTER
		MARK IT ZERO!

				SMOKEY
		Walter--

				WALTER
		YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?  
		MARK IT ZERO!!

				SMOKEY
		All right!  There it is!  It's fucking 
		zero!

He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.

				SMOKEY
		You happy, you crazy fuck?

				WALTER
		This is a league game, Smokey!

PARKING LOT

Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian 
trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

				DUDE
		Walter, you can't do that.  These 
		guys're like me, they're pacificists.  
		Smokey was a conscientious objector.

				WALTER
		You know Dude, I myself dabbled with 
		pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, 
		of course--

				DUDE
		And you know Smokey has emotional 
		problems!

				WALTER
		You mean--beyond pacifism?

				DUDE
		He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

As the two men get into the car:

				WALTER
		Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, 
		it's water under the bridge.  And we 
		do enter the next round-robin, am I 
		wrong?

				DUDE
		No, you're not wrong--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		You're not wrong, Walter, you're 
		just an asshole.

They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

				WALTER
		Okay then.  We play Quintana and 
		O'Brien next week.  They'll be 
		pushovers.

				DUDE
		Just, just take it easy, Walter.

				WALTER
		That's your answer to everything, 
		Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism 
		is not--look at our current situation 
		with that camelfucker in Iraq--
		pacifism is not something to hide 
		behind.

				DUDE
		Well, just take 't easy, man.

				WALTER
		I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

				WALTER
			(smugly)
		Calmer than you are.

-his irritates the Dude further.

				DUDE
		Just take it easy, man!

Walter is still smug.

				WALTER
		Calmer than you are.

DUDE'S HOUSE

A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
up old furniture.

At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing 
kalhua, rum and milk.

				VOICE
		Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't 
		wanna be a hard-on about this, and I 
		know it wasn't your fault, but I 
		just thought it was fair to tell you 
		that Gene and I will be submitting 
		this to the League and asking them 
		to set aside the round.  Or maybe 
		forfeit it to us--

				DUDE
		Shit!

				VOICE
		--so, like I say, just thought, you 
		know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

A beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, 
		well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.  
		Please call us as soon as is 
		convenient.

Beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski 
		with the Southern Cal Bowling League.  
		I just got a, an informal report, 
		uh, that a uh, a member of your team, 
		uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded 
		weapon during league play--

We hear the doorbell.

THE DOOR

It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding 
middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.

				DUDE
		Hiya Allan.

				ALLAN
		Dude, I finally got the venue I 
		wanted.  I'm Performing my dance 
		quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane 
		Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on 
		Tuesday night, and I'd love it if 
		you came and gave me notes.

The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.

				DUDE
		Sure Allan, I'll be there.

				ALLAN
		Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the 
		tenth.

				DUDE
		Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

				ALLAN
		Just, uh, just slip the rent under 
		my door.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

The  voice continues on the machine.

				VOICE
		--serious infraction, and examine 
		your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

				VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please 
		do call us when you get in and I'll 
		send the limo.  Let me assure you--I 
		hope you're not avoiding this call 
		because of the rug, which, I assure 
		you, is not a problem.  We need your 
		help and, uh--well we would very 
		much like to see you.  Thank you.  
		It's Brandt.

TRACKING

We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.  
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back 
over

HIS SHOULDER:

				BRANDT
		We've had some terrible news.  Mr. 
		Lebowski is in seclusion in the West 
		Wing.

				DUDE
		Huh.

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music 
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey 
Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly 
into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski.

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.

				LEBOWSKI
		It's funny.  I can look back on a 
		life of achievement, on challenges 
		met, competitors bested, obstacles 
		overcome.  I've accomplished more 
		than most men, and without the use 
		of my legs.  What. . . What makes a 
		man, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Huh?

				DUDE
		I don't know, sir.

				LEBOWSKI
		Is it. . . is it, being prepared to 
		do the right thing?  Whatever the 
		price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

				DUDE
		Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost 
in thought.

				LEBOWSKI
		You're joking.  But perhaps you're 
		right.

The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.

				DUDE
		Mind if I smoke a jay?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny.

He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on 
his cheeks.

				DUDE
		'Scuse me?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light 
		of my life.  Are you surprised at my 
		tears, sir?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				LEBOWSKI
		Strong men also cry. . . Strong men 
		also cry.

He clears his throat.

				LEBOWSKI
		I received this fax this morning.

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and 
hands it to the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		As you can see, it is a ransom note.  
		Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable 
		to achieve on a level field of play.  
		Men who will not sign their names.  
		Weaklings.  Bums.

THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:

WE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.

				DUDE
		Bummer.

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt will fill you in on the 
		details.

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.  
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the 
hall.

HALLWAY

The soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice 
is hushed:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a 
		generous offer to you to act as 
		courier once we get instructions for 
		the money.

				DUDE
		Why me, man?

				BRANDT
		He suspects that the culprits might 
		be the very people who, uh, soiled 
		your rug, and you're in a unique 
		position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm 
		that suspicion.

				DUDE
		So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, 
		huh?

				BRANDT
		Well Dude, we just don't know.

BOWLING PINS

CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

WIDER

Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of 
the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying 
perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch 
bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.

FAST TRACK IN

On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic 
chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

				DUDE
		Fucking Quintana--that creep can 
		roll, man--

BACK TO THE BOWLER

Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's 
conversation continues over.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, 
		Dude.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		The man is a sex offender.  With a 
		record.  Spent six months in Chino 
		for exposing himself to an eight-
		year-old.

FLASHBACK

We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,  
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging 
the bell.

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.

				DUDE
		Huh.

				WALTER
		When he moved down to Venice he had 
		to go door-to-door to tell everyone 
		he's a pederast.

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man 
looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

				DONNY
		What's a pederast, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.

PINS

scattered by a strike.

QUINTANA

wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.

Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his 
first name, ""Jesus"".

BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE

They have been joined by Donny.

				WALTER
		Anyway.  How much they offer you?

				DUDE
		Twenty grand.  And of course I still 
		keep the rug.

				WALTER
		Just for making the hand-off?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.

				DUDE
		...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so  
		whenever these guys call--

				WALTER
		What if it's during a game?

				DUDE
		I told him if it was during league 
		play--

Donny has been watching Quintana.

				DONNY
		If what's during league play?

				WALTER
		Life does not stop and start at your 
		convenience, you miserable piece of 
		shit.

				DONNY
		What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

				DUDE
		I figure it's easy money, it's all 
		pretty harmless.  I mean she probably 
		kidnapped herself.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DONNY
		What do you mean, Dude?

				DUDE
		Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean 
		look at it.  Young trophy wife.  
		Marries a guy for money but figures 
		he isn't giving her enough.  She 
		owes money all over town--

				WALTER
		That...fucking...bitch!

				DUDE
		It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin 
		said, look for the person who will 
		benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, 
		you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying 
		to say--

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		That fucking bitch!

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!  
		Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				WALTER
		That's fucking exactly what happened, 
		Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

				DONNY
		Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed 
		off?

				WALTER
		Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking 
		thing-- I did not watch my buddies 
		die face down in the muck so that 
		this fucking strumpet--

				DUDE
		I don't see any connection to Vietnam, 
		Walter.

				WALTER
		Well, there isn't a literal 
		connection, Dude.

				DUDE
		Walter, face it, there isn't any 
		connection.  It's your roll.

				WALTER
		Have it your way.  The point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll--

				WALTER
		The fucking point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll.

				VOICE
		Are you ready to be fucked, man?

They both look up.

Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of 
the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a 
windbreaker with a racing stripe and ""Jesus"" stitched on the 
breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball 
satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his 
partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.

				QUINTANA
		I see you rolled your way into the 
		semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and 
		me, we're gonna fuck you up.

				DUDE
		Yeah well, that's just, ya know, 
		like, your opinion, man.

Quintana looks at Walter.

				QUINTANA
		Let me tell you something, bendeco.  
		You pull any your crazy shit with 
		us, you flash a piece out on the 
		lanes, I'll take it away from you 
		and stick it up your ass and pull 
		the fucking trigger til it goes 
		""click"".

				DUDE
		Jesus.

				QUINTANA
		You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with 
		the Jesus.

Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.

				WALTER
		Eight-year-olds, Dude.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  
His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an 
intermittent clatter.

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE 
BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.

The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall 
rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the 
Dude opens his eyes.

He screams.

A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  
in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards 
the carrier.

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head 
thunking back onto the rug.

A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear 
the ""La-la-la-la"" of The Man in Me.

The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of 
Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in 
front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his 
bowling shirt. He looks up.

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the 
Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing 
us, growing smaller.

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices 
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic 
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its 
weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He 
is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down 
toward the city, dragged by the ball.

A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us 
out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  
the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in 
black.

We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections 
materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny 
surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of 
a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being 
regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass 
rolling a huge shadow across his face.

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward 
us --finger holes.

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing 
us once again in black..

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a 
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in 
the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde 
woman, performing her follow-through.

Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and 
away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; 
ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins 
spin, hit each other and drop.

We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.

FADE IN

We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades 
in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is 
now askew, with one arm off his ear.

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put 
him right side around.  His head is now resting against 
hardwood floor, not rug.

				DUDE
		Oh man.

He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  
red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  
blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.

WIDE ON THE ROOM

An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  
in place. The rug is gone.

The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   
The beeps continue.

The phone starts to jangle.

TRACK

We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   
Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  
wrist to  look at  his watch.

				BRANDT
		They called about eighty minutes 
		ago.  They want you to take the money 
		and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll 
		call you on the portable phone with 
		instructions in about forty minutes.  
		One person only or I'd go with you.  
		They were very clear on that: one 
		person only.  What happened to your 
		jaw?

				DUDE
		Oh, nothin', you know.

They have reached the little desk outside of the big 
Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key 
and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude 
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

				BRANDT
		Here's the money, and the phone.  
		Please, Dude, follow whatever 
		instructions they give.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Oh, man, don't say that..

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Shit.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands, Dude.  
		And report back to us as soon as 
		it's done.

DUDE'S CAR

We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through 
the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter 
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK 
SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the 
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look 
oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape 
bundled in brown wrapping paper.

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door 
and hands in the briefcase.

				WALTER
		Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.

				DUDE
		The what?

				WALTER
		The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have 
		they called yet?

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it 
as the car starts rolling.

				DUDE
		What the hell is this?

				WALTER
		My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  
		The whites.

				DUDE
		Agh--

He closes the briefcase.

				DUDE
		Walter, I'm sure there's a reason 
		you brought your dirty undies--

				WALTER
		Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  
		The ringer can't look empty.

				DUDE
		Walter--what the fuck are you 
		thinking?

				WALTER
		Well you're right, Dude, I got to 
		thinking.  I got to thinking why 
		should we settle for a measly fucking 
		twenty grand--

				DUDE
		We?  What the fuck we?  You said you 
		just wanted to come along--

				WALTER
		My point, Dude, is why should we 
		settle for twenty grand when we can 
		keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a 
		fucking game, Walter--

				WALTER
		It is a fucking game.  You said so 
		yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

				DUDE '
		Yeah, but--

The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
			(German accent)
		Who is this?

				DUDE
		Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want 
		us to go?

				VOICE
		...Us?
		DUDE

Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not 
handling the money and driving the car and talking on the 
phone all by my fucking--

				VOICE
		Shut the fuck up.
			(Beat)
		Hello?

				DUDE
		Yeah?

				VOICE
		Okay, listen--

Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

				WALTER
		Dude, are you fucking this up?

				VOICE
		Who is that?

				DUDE
		The driver man, I told you--

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		Oh shit.  Walter.

				WALTER
		What the fuck is going on there?

				DUDE
		They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it 
		up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was 
		in our hands!

				WALTER
		Easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		We're screwed now!  We don't get 
		shit and they're gonna kill her!  
		We're fucked, Walter!

				WALTER
		Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.  
		You're being very unDude.  They'll 
		call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

The phone chirps.

				WALTER
		Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, 
		Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These  
		guys are fucking amateurs--

				DUDE
		Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say 
		peep when I'm doing business here.

				WALTER
			(patronizing)
		Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

				WALTER
		But they're amateurs.

The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
		Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there 
		is no funny stuff.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				VOICE
		So no funny stuff.  Okay?

				DUDE
		Hey, just tell me where the fuck you 
		want us to go.

A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD

It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

				DUDE
		That was the sign.

Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

				WALTER
		Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, 
		nobody's in a position to complain.  
		And we keep the baksheesh.

				DUDE
		Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't 
		told me how we get her back.  Where 
		is she?

				WALTER
		That's the simple part, Dude.  When  
		we make the handoff, I grab the guy 
		and beat  it out of him.

He looks at the Dude.

				WALTER
		...Huh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  
		That's fucking ingenious, if I 
		understand it correctly.  That's a 
		Swiss fucking watch.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of 
		this is its simplicity. If the plan 
		gets too complex something always 
		goes wrong.  If there's one thing I 
		learned in Nam--

The phone chirps.

				DUDE
		Dude.

				VOICE
		You are approaching a vooden britch.  
		When you cross it you srow ze bag 
		from ze left vindow of ze moving 
		kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch 
		you.

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		FUCK.

				WALTER
		What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
		off?

				DUDE
		There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   
		At a wooden bridge we throw the money 
		out  of the car!

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		We throw the money out of the moving 
		car!

Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

				WALTER
		We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks 
		up our plan.

				DUDE
		Well call them up and explain it to 
		'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking 
		simple, I'm sure they'd fucking 
		understand it!  That's the beauty of 
		it Walter!

				WALTER
		Wooden bridge, huh?

				DUDE
		I'm throwing the money, Walter!  
		We're not fucking around!

				WALTER
		The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the 
		ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

				DUDE
		Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but 
		sooner or later you're gonna have to 
		face the fact that you're a goddamn 
		moron.

				WALTER
		Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's 
		the bridge--

There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from 
the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to 
grab the laundry.

And there goes the ringer.

He flings it out the window.

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

				DUDE
		What the fuck?

				WALTER
		Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch 
		I roll out!  I double back, grab one 
		of 'em and beat it out of him!  The 
		uzi!

				DUDE
		Uzi?

Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

				WALTER
		You didn't think I was rolling out 
		of here naked!

				DUDE
		Walter, please--

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out 
over the road.

				WALTER
		Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's 
		take that hill!

Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he 
hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, 
cursing, takes the wheel.

OUTSIDE

Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle 
flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

INSIDE THE CAR

The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

OUTSIDE

The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

INSIDE

The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

OUTSIDE

As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The 
front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps 
back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.

WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  
injured knee.

The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  
frantically waving the satchel in the air.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!

There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto 
the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires 
squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite 
direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring 
motorcycles.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching 
the three red tail lights fishtail away.

AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:

				WALTER
		Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

BOWLING LANE

A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.

WALTER.

He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of 
molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable 
phone in his lap.  It is ringing.

				WALTER
		Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used 
		to say.

				DUDE
		What the fuck is that supposed to 
		mean?  What the fuck're we gonna 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't 
		see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

The portable phone stops ringing.

				DUDE
		Huh?  The problem is--what do you 
		mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
		they're gonna kill that poor woman--

				WALTER
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		That poor woman--that poor slut--
		kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said 
		so yourself--

				DUDE
		No, Walter!  I said I thought she 
		kidnapped herself!  You're the one 
		who's so fucking certain--

				WALTER
		That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

Donny is trotting excitedly up.

				DONNY
		They posted the next round of the 
		tournament--

				WALTER
		Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

				DONNY
		This Saturday.  Quintana and--

				WALTER
		Saturday!  Well they'll have to 
		reschedule.

				DUDE
		Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		I told that fuck down at the league 
		office-- who's in charge of 
		scheduling?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				DONNY
		Burkhalter.

				WALTER
		I told that kraut a fucking thousand 
		times I don't roll on shabbas.

				DONNY
		It's already posted.

				WALTER
		WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about 
		that poor woman?  What do we tell--

				WALTER
		C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get 
		sick of her little game and, you 
		know, wander back--

				DONNY
		How come you don't roll on Saturday, 
		Walter?

				WALTER
		I'm shomer shabbas.

				DONNY
		What's that, Walter?

				DUDE
		Yeah, and in the meantime what do I 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of 
		rest.  Means I don't work, I don't 
		drive a car, I don't fucking ride in 
		a car, I don't handle money, I don't 
		turn on the oven, and I sure as shit 
		don't fucking roll!

				DONNY
		Sheesh.

				DUDE
		Walter, how--

				WALTER
		Shomer shabbas.

The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

				DUDE
		That's it.  I'm out of here.

				WALTER
		For Christ's sake, Dude.

Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling 
alley.

Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the 
hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--

				DONNY
		Oh yeah, how'd it go?

				WALTER
		Went alright.  Dude's car got a little 
		dinged up--

				DUDE
		But Walter, we didn't make the fucking 
		hand- off!  They didn't get, the 
		fucking money and they're gonna--
		they're gonna--

				WALTER
		Yeah yeah, ""kill that poor woman.""

He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

				WALTER
		Kill that poor woman.

				DONNY
		Walter, if you can't ride in a car, 
		how d'you get around on Shammas--

				WALTER
		Really, Dude, you surprise me.  
		They're not gonna kill shit.  They're 
		not gonna do shit.  What can they 
		do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, 
		look at the bottom line.  Who's 
		sitting on a million fucking dollars?  
		Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		Who's got a fucking million fucking 
		dollars parked in the trunk of our 
		car out here?

				DUDE
		""Our"" car, Walter?

				WALTER
		And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty 
		undies.  My fucking whites--Say, 
		where is  the car?

The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out 
at an empty parking space.

				DONNY
		Who has your undies, Walter?

				WALTER
		Where's your car, Dude?

				DUDE
		You don't know, Walter?  You seem to 
		know the answer to everything else!

				WALTER
		Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped 
		spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

				DUDE
		It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking 
		know it's been stolen!

				WALTER
		Well, certainly that's a possibility, 
		Dude--

				DUDE
		Aw, fuck it.

The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts 
ringing again.

				DONNY
		Where you going, Dude?

				DUDE
		I'm going home, Donny.

				DONNY
		Your phone's ringing, Dude.

				DUDE
		Thank you, Donny.

DUDE'S LIVING ROOM

The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, 
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him 
on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, 
the other a fresh-faced rookie.

At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  
The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:

				DUDE
		1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

				YOUNGER COP
		Color?

				DUDE
		Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, 
		coloration.

				YOUNGER COP
		And was there anything of value in  
		the car?

DULLY:

				DUDE
		Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple 
		of Creedence tapes.  And there was 
		a, uh. . . my briefcase.

				YOUNGER COP
		In the briefcase?

				DUDE
		Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my 
		papers.  Business papers.

				YOUNGER COP
		And what do you do, sir?

				DUDE
		I'm unemployed.

				OLDER COP
		...Most people, we're working nights, 
		they offer us coffee.

There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the 
floor.  The older cop stares at him.

				DUDE
		...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But 
		it's nice when they offer.

AT LENGTH:

				DUDE
		...Also, my rug was stolen.

				YOUNGER COP
		Your rug was in the car.

The Dude taps the floor with his foot.

				DUDE
		No.  Here.

				YOUNGER COP
		Separate incidents?

The Dude stares at the floor.

Silence.

				OLDER COP
		Snap out of it, son.

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  
chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  
it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks 
on.

				DUDE
		You find them much?  Stolen cars?

Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message 
after the beep.  It takes a minute.

				YOUNGER COP
		Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much 
		hope for the tape deck though.  Or 
		the Creedence tapes.

				DUDE
		And the, uh, the briefcase?

Beep.

				FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  
		Call when you get home and I'll send 
		a car for you.  My name is Maude 
		Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took 
		the rug.

Beep.  Dial tone.

				OLDER COP
		Well, I guess we can close the file 
		on that one.

TRACKING FORWARD

We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown 
L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing 
industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are 
spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant 
rug.

We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, 
standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky 
depths of the cavernous space.

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended 
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the 
floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush 
in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two 
young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers 
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track 
and haul it back for another push.

				VOICE
		I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. 
		Lebowski.

She rumbles by in another pass.

All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  
Help me down.

The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  
except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  
and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix 
look.

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Is that what that's a picture of?

				MAUDE
		In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. 
		My art has been commended as being 
		strongly vaginal.  Which bothers 
		some men.  The word itself makes 
		some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

				DUDE
		Oh yeah?

				MAUDE
		Yes, they don't like hearing it and 
		find it difficult to say.  Whereas 
		without batting an eye a man will 
		refer to his ""dick"" or his ""rod"" or 
		his ""Johnson"".

				DUDE
		""Johnson""?

				MAUDE
		Thank you.

This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.

All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father 
told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a 
gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  
Now.  As for this. . . ""kidnapping""--

				DUDE
		Huh?

				MAUDE
		Yes, I know about it.  And I know 
		that you acted as courier.  And let 
		me tell you something:  the whole 
		thing stinks to high heaven.

				DUDE
		Right, but let me explain something 
		about that rug--

				MAUDE
		Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				MAUDE
		Sex.  The physical act of love.  
		Coitus.  Do you like it?

				DUDE
		I was talking about my rug.

				MAUDE
		You're not interested in sex?

				DUDE
		You mean coitus?

				MAUDE
		I like it too.  It's a male myth 
		about feminists that we hate sex.  
		It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. 
		But unfortunately there are some 
		people--it is called satyriasis in 
		men, nymphomania in women--who engage 
		in it compulsively and without joy.

				DUDE
		Oh, no.

				MAUDE
		Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate 
		souls cannot love in the true sense 
		of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance 
		Bunny is one of these.

				DUDE
		Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your 
		stepmother is a nympho, but I don't 
		see what it has to do with--do you 
		have any kalhua?

				MAUDE
		Take a look at this, sir.

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen 
flickers to life.  A title card:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

SECOND CARD:

KARL HUNGUS

AND

BUNNY LAJOYA

IN

A THIRD CARD:

LOGJAMMIN'

The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  
to his glass.

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a 
door opening.

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  
man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  
Lebowski's pool.

				DIETER
		Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere 
		iss problem mit deine kable.

				DUDE
		Shit, I know that guy.  He's a 
		nihilist.

				MAUDE
		And you recognize her, of course.

The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

Bunny The TV is in here.

				DIETER
		Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use 
the shower.

				MAUDE
			(grimly)
		The story is ludicrous.

				DIETER
		Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to 
		verk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set.

				MAUDE
		Lord.  You can imagine where it goes 
		from here.

				DUDE
		He fixes the cable?

				MAUDE
		Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little 
		matter to me that this woman chose 
		to pursue a career

in pornography, nor that she has been ""banging"" Jackie 
Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am 
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other 
being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts 
and--

				DUDE
		Shit yeah, the achievers.

				MAUDE
		Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		yes, and proud we are of all of them.  
		I asked my father about his withdrawal 
		of a million dollars from the 
		Foundation account and he told me 
		about this ""abduction"", but I tell 
		you it is preposterous.  This 
		compulsive

fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but my-

				MAUDE
		I'm getting to your rug. My  father 
		and I don't get along; he doesn't 
		approve of my lifestyle and, needless 
		to say, I don't approve of his.  
		Still, I hardly wish to make my 
		father's embezzlement a police matter, 
		so I'm proposing that you try to 
		recover the money from the people 
		you delivered it to.

				DUDE
		Well--sure, I could do that--

				MAUDE
		If you successfully do so, I will 
		compensate you to the tune of 1% of 
		the recovered sum.

				DUDE
		A hundred.

				MAUDE
		Thousand, yes, bones or clams or 
		whatever you call them.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but what about--

				MAUDE
		--your rug, yes, well with that money 
		you can buy any number of rugs that 
		don't have sentimental value for me.  
		And I am sorry about that crack on 
		the jaw.

The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has 
all but disappeared.

				DUDE
		Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

				MAUDE
		Here's the name and number of a doctor 
		who will look at it for you.  You 
		will receive no bill.  He's a good 
		man, and thorough.

				DUDE
		That's really thoughtful but I--

				MAUDE
		Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

LIMO

The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to 
the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery 
cap a ponytail emerges.

				DRIVER
		--So he says, ""My son can't hold a 
		job, my daughter's married to a 
		fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on 
		my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  
		But you know me.  I can't complain.""

THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.			 
		Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya 
		Tony.

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves 
milk on his mustache.

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a 
little  money, I  was down in the dumps.

				TONY
		Aw, forget about it.

				DUDE
		Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be 
		worrying about that shit.  Life goes 
		on!

The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still 
holding his drink.

				TONY
		Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your 
		friend in the Volkswagon?

				DUDE
		Huh?

His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his 
shoulder.

He followed us here.

The Dude turns to look.

HIS POV

Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the 
curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

THE DUDE

He scowls.

				DUDE
		When did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

				SECOND CHAUFFEUR
		Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No 
		arguments.

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds 
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.

				DUDE
		Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

INSIDE

The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the 
rear. The door is slammed behind him.

				LEBOWSKI
		Start talking and talk fast you lousy 
		bum!

				BRANDT
		We've been frantically trying to 
		reach you, Dude.

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from 
the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

				LEBOWSKI
		Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

				DUDE
		Well we--I don't--

				LEBOWSKI
		They did not receive the money, you 
		nitwit!  They  did not receive the 
		goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR 
		HANDS!

				BRANDT
		This is our concern, Dude.

				DUDE
		No, man, nothing is fucked here--

				LEBOWSKI
		NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE 
		HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!

The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.

				DUDE
		C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?  
		Those guys are--we dropped off the 
		damn money--

				LEBOWSKI
		WHAT?!

				DUDE
		I--the royal we, you know, the 
		editorial--I dropped off the money, 
		exactly as per--Look, I've got certain 
		information, certain things have 
		come to light, and uh, has it ever 
		occurred to you, man, that given the 
		nature of all this new shit, that, 
		uh, instead of running around blaming 
		me, that this whole thing might just 
		be, not, you know, not just such a 
		simple, but uh--you know?

				LEBOWSKI
		What in God's holy name are you 
		blathering about?

				DUDE
		I'll tell you what I'm blathering 
		about!  I got information--new shit 
		has come to light and--shit, man!  
		She kidnapped herself!

Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.

				DUDE
		Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy 
		wife, I mean, in the parlance of our 
		times, owes money all over town, 
		including to known pornographers--
		and that's cool, that's cool-- but 
		I'm saying, she needs money, and of 
		course they're gonna say they didn't 
		get it 'cause she wants more, man, 
		she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
		hasn't that ever occurred to you...?  
		Sir?

				LEBOWSKI
			(quietly)
		No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not 
		occurred to me.

				BRANDT
		That had not occurred to us, Dude.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, you're not privy to all 
		the new shit, so uh, you know, but 
		that's what you pay me for.  Speaking 
		of which, would it be possible for 
		me to get my twenty grand in cash?  
		I gotta check this with my accountant 
		of course, but my concern is that, 
		you know, it could bump me into a 
		higher tax--

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt, give him the envelope.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, if you've already made 
		out the check.  Brandt is handing 
		him a letter-sized envelope which is 
		distended by something inside.

				BRANDT
		We received it this morning.

The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton 
wadding and unrolls it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Since you have failed to achieve, 
		even in the modest task that was 
		your charge, since you have stolen 
		my money, and since you have 
		unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up 
inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and 
starts to unroll the inner package.

				LEBOWSKI
		I have no choice but to tell these 
		bums that they should do whatever is 
		necessary to recover their money 
		from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And 
		with Brandt as my witness, tell you 
		this:  Any further harm visited upon 
		Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon 
		your head.

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents 
of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

				LEBOWSKI
		...By God sir.  I will not abide 
		another toe.

COFFEE SHOP

The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off 
into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little 
clinking noises.

AFTER A LONG BEAT:

				WALTER
		That wasn't her toe.

				DUDE
		Whose toe was it, Walter?

				WALTER
		How the fuck should I know?  I do 
		know that nothing about it indicates--

				DUDE
		The nail polish, Walter.

				WALTER
		Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible 
		to get some nail polish, apply it to 
		someone else's toe--

				DUDE
		Someone else's--where the fuck are 
		they gonna--

				WALTER
		You want a toe?  I can get you a 
		toe, believe me.  There are ways, 
		Dude.  You don't wanna know about 
		it, believe me.

				DUDE
		But Walter--

				WALTER
		I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this 
		afternoon--with nail  polish. These  
		fucking amateurs.   They send us a  
		toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- 
		selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My  
		point is--

				DUDE
		They're gonna kill her, Walter, and 
		then they're gonna kill me--

				WALTER
		Well that's just, that's the stress 
		talking, Dude.  So far we have what 
		looks to me like a series of 
		victimless crimes--

				DUDE
		What about the toe?

				WALTER
		FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

A waitress enters.

				WAITRESS
		Could you please keep your voices 
		down--this is a family restaurant.

				WALTER
		Oh, please dear!  I've got news for 
		you: the Supreme Court has roundly 
		rejected prior restraint!

				DUDE
		Walter, this isn't a First Amendment 
		thing.

				WAITRESS
		Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going 
		to have to ask you to leave.

				WALTER
		Lady, I got buddies who died face-
		down in the muck so you and I could 
		enjoy this family restaurant!

THE DUDE GETS UP:

				DUDE
		All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry 
		ma'am.

				WALTER
		Don't run away from this, Dude!  
		Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

				WALTER
		Our basic freedoms!

He looks defiantly around.

				WALTER
		I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, 
affecting nonchalance.

				WALTER
		Finishing my coffee.

DUDE'S BATHROOM

A dripping noise.

The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint 
pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.

The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the 
soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.

After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer 
		Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		We've recovered your vehicle.  It 
		can be claimed at the North Hollywood 
		Auto Circus there on Victory.

				DUDE
		Far out.  Far fuckin' out.

				MESSAGE
		You'll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of 
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

				DUDE
		Hunh?

He looks blearily at the open doorway.

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is 
striding across the living room towards the bathroom.

				DUDE
		Hey!  This is a private residence, 
		man!

The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the 
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other 
men are entering behind him.

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; 
the men are backlit shapes.

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small 
animal skitters excitedly about the floor.

The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

				DUDE
		Nice marmot.

The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, 
screaming, into the bathtub.

The Dude screams.

The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a 
frenzy of fearful aggression.

				FIRST MAN
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to 
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his 
head and squishes him back into the water.

				SECOND MAN
		You think veer kidding und making 
		mit de funny stuff?

				THIRD MAN
		Vee could do things you only dreamed 
		of, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.  
		Vee belief in nossing.

He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself 
off, spraying the Dude.

				DUDE
		Jesus!

				DIETER
		Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!  
		NOSSING!!

The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking 
itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

				DUDE
		Jesus Christ!

				FIRST MAN
		Tomorrow vee come back und cut off 
		your chonson.

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				FIRST MAN
		I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!

The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:

				SECOND MAN
		Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

				FIRST MAN
		Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und 
		skvush it, Lebowski!

NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS

A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a 
large parking lot.

				POLICEMAN
		You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.  
		Lebowski. Must've been a joyride 
		situation; they abandoned the car 
		once they hit the retaining wall.

They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side  
exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude  
a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.

				POLICEMAN
		These were on the road next to the 
		car.  You'll have to get in on the 
		other side.

The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

				POLICEMAN
		Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.  
		You're lucky they left the tape deck 
		though.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's 
		that smell?

				POLICEMAN
		Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept 
		in the car.  Or perhaps just used it 
		as a toilet, and moved on.

The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will 
not go; he bellows through the glass:

				DUDE
		When will you find these guys?  I 
		mean, do you have any promising leads?

The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.

				POLICEMAN
		Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with 
		the boys down at the Crime Lab.  
		They've assigned four more detectives 
		to the case, got us working in shifts.

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman 
rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by 
the glass.

BOWLING ALLEY BAR

The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a 
White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer 
nuts.

				DONNY
		And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

				WALTER
		Oh for Christ--will you shut the 
		fuck up, Donny.

				DUDE
		I figure my only hope is that the 
		big Lebowski kills me before the 
		Germans can cut my dick off.

				WALTER
		Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No 
		one is going to cut your dick off.

				DUDE
		Thanks Walter.

				WALTER
		Not if I have anything to say about 
		it.

				DUDE
			(bitterly)
		Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me 
		a very secure feeling.

				WALTER
		Dude--

				DUDE
		That makes me feel all warm inside.

				WALTER
		Now Dude--

				DUDE
		This whole fucking thing--I  could 
		be sitting here with just pee-stains 
		on my rug.

Walter sadly shakes his head.

				WALTER
		Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.  
		Fucking Nazis.

				DONNY
		They were Nazis, Dude?

				WALTER
		Come on, Donny, they were threatening 
		castration!

				DONNY
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Are you gonna split hairs?

				DONNY
		No--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong?

				DONNY
		Well--

				DUDE
		They're nihilists.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		They kept saying they believe in 
		nothing.

				WALTER
		Nihilists!  Jesus.

Walter looks haunted.

Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, 
Dude, at least it's an ethos.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		And let's also not forget--let's not 
		forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, 
		an amphibious rodent, for uh, 
		domestic, you know, within the city--
		that isn't legal either.

				DUDE
		What're you, a fucking park ranger 
		now?

				WALTER
		No, I'm--

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit about the fucking 
		marmot!

				WALTER
		--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

				DUDE
		Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need 
		your sympathy, man, I need my fucking 
		Johnson!

				DONNY
		What do you need that for, Dude?

				WALTER
		You gotta buck up, man, you can't go 
		into the tournament with this negative 
		attitude--

				DUDE
		Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you, 
		Walter!

There is a moment of stunned silence.

				WALTER
		Fuck the tournament?!

SAD; QUIET:

				WALTER
		Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want 
		to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's 
		go get a lane.

They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares

DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

				DUDE
		Another Caucasian, Gary.

				VOICE
		Right, Dude.

STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

				DUDE
		Friends like these, huh Gary.

				GARY
		That's right, Dude.

The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on 
""Tumbling Tumbleweeds.""

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter 
vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam 
Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and 
wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.

TO THE BARTENDER:

				MAN
		D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?

We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened 
the movie.

				BARTENDER
		Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

The Stranger nods.

				THE STRANGER
		That's a good one.

Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His 
crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		How ya doin' there, Dude?

The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.

				DUDE
		Ahh, not so good, man.

				THE STRANGER
		One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser 
		fella than m'self once said, sometimes 
		you eat the bar and sometimes the 
		bar, wal, he eats you.

				DUDE
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern 
		thing?

				THE STRANGER
		Far from it.

				DUDE
		Mm.

The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the 
bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.

				THE STRANGER
		Much obliged.

He looks back at the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		I like your style, Dude.

THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

				DUDE
		Well I like your style too, man.  
		Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

				THE STRANGER
		Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.  
		D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how 
out of place the cowpoke is.

				DUDE
		The fuck are you talking about?

The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the 
bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Okay, have it your way.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.

				THE STRANGER
		Take it easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Thanks man.

He is gone.  ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" is ending as we hear an 
offscreen voice, breaking the spell:

				VOICE
		Dude!  Dude!

THE DUDE LOOKS:

Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, 
beckoning.

MAUDE'S LOFT

She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just 
cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the 
		doctor.

				DUDE
		No it's fine, really, uh--

				MAUDE
		Do you have any news regarding my 
		father's money?

				DUDE
		I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta 
		respecfully, 69 you know, tender my 
		resignation on that matter, 'cause 
		it looks like your mother really was 
		kidnapped after all.

				MAUDE
		She most certainly was not!

				DUDE
		Hey man, why don't you fucking listen 
		occasionally?  You might learn 
		something.  Now I got--

				MAUDE
		And please don't call her my mother.

				DUDE
		Now I got--

				MAUDE
		She is most definitely the perpetrator 
		and not the victim.

				DUDE
		I'm telling you, I got definitive 
		evidence--

				MAUDE
		From who?

				DUDE
		The main guy, Dieter--

				MAUDE
		Dieter Hauff?

				DUDE
		Well--yeah, I guess--

				MAUDE
		Her ""co-star"" in the beaver picture?

				DUDE
		Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, 
		you know him?

				MAUDE
		Dieter has been on the fringes of--
		well, of everything in L.A., for 
		about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.  
		Under 'Autobahn.'

The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.

				MAUDE
		That was his group--they released 
		one album in the mid-seventies.

The Dude stops between two albums.

				DUDE
		Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

				MAUDE
		Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their 
		music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is 
the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a 
picture

OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW 
SLICKED-

back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are 
wearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name 
under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of 
nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

				MAUDE
		Is he pretending to be the abductor?

				DUDE
		Well...yeah--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, you don't really  
		kidnap someone that you're acquainted 
		with.  You can't get away with it if 
		the hostage knows who you are.

				DUDE
		Well yeah...I know that.

				MAUDE
		So Dieter has the money?

				DUDE
		Well, no, not exactly.  It's a 
		complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.  
		Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to 
		keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands 
		in old Duder's--

				MAUDE
		Do you still have that doctor's 
		number?

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, really, I don't even have 
		the bruise any more, I--

She is scribbling.

				MAUDE
		Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be 
		responsible for any delayed after-
		effects.

				DUDE
		Delayed after-eff--

				MAUDE
		I want you to see him immediately.

She is picking up a telephone.

				MAUDE
		I'll see if he's available.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE

His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of 
""Comin' Up Around the Bend.""

Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, 
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a 
moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His 
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the 
Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

				VOICE
		Could you slide your shorts down 
		please, Mr.  Lebowski?

The Dude's eyes open.

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

				VOICE
		I understand sir.  Could you slide 
		your shorts down please?

DUDE'S CAR

The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude 
is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and, noticing something, looks again.

HIS POV

A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.

THE DUDE

His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint 
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it 
out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering 
sparks.

DUDE'S CROTCH

The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. 
The Dude screams.

THE STREET

The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off 
to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes 
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone 
poll.

INSIDE THE CAR

The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, 
and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which 
also won't open.

				DUDE
		Fuck Me.

But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  
the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion 
and back cushion.

				DUDE
		Fuckola, man.

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   
There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper 
sticking out from between the cushions.

The Dude pulls it out.

It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and 
dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, 
Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled ""The Louisiana 
Purchase.""  In red ink is a large circled D and some 
handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled 
in red throughout.

CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage 
in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, 
is performing a dance moderne.

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice 
hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse 
audience.

				WALTER
		He lives in North Hollywood on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DUDE
		The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

				WALTER
		Near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DONNY
		Those are good burgers, Walter.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid 
		is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his 
		father is--are you ready for this?--
		Arthur Digby Sellers.

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

				WALTER
		Who the f--have you ever heard of a 
		little show called Branded, Dude?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		All but one man died?  There at Bitter 
		Creek?

				DUDE
		Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show 
		Walter, so what?

				WALTER
		Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 
		156 episodes, Dude.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		The bulk of the series.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Not exactly a lightweight.

				DUDE
		No.

				WALTER
		And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

				DUDE
		Uh.

				WALTER
		Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out 
		there after the, uh, the.

He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

				WALTER
		What have you.  We'll, uh--

				DONNY
		We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, 
		brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.  
		We'll get that fucking money, if he 
		hasn't spent it already.  Million 
		fucking clams. And yes, we'll be 
		near the, uh--some burgers, some 
		beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking 
		troubles are over, Dude.

RESIDENTIAL AREA

The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated 
house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in 
front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.

				DUDE
		Fuck me, man!  That kid's already 
		spent all the money!

				WALTER
		Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's 
		still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, 
		depending on the options.  Wait in 
		the car, Donny.

THE FRONT DOOR

Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish 
woman.

				WOMAN
		Jace?

				WALTER
		Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter 
		Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this 
		is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WOMAN
		Jace.

				WALTER
		May we uh, we wanted to talk about 
		little Larry.  May we come in?

				WOMAN
		Jace.

They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as 
Pilar

CALLS UP THE STAIRS:

				PILAR
		Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and 
nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man 
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its 
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct 
hisses in and out.

				WALTER
		That's him, Dude.

				VIVA VOCE
		And a good day to you, sir.

				PILAR
		See down, please.

				WALTER
		Thank you, ma'am.

He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered 
voice, to Pilar:

				WALTER
		Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

				PILAR
		No, no.  He has healt' problems.

				WALTER
		Uh-huh.

HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:

				WALTER
		I just want to say, sir, that we're 
		both enormous--on a personal level, 
		Branded, especially the early 
		episodes, has been a source of, uh, 
		inspir---

There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year-
old, looks at the two men.

				PILAR
		See down, Sweetie.  These are the 
		policeman--

				WALTER
		No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the 
		impression that we're police exactly.  
		We're hoping that it will not be 
		necessary to call the police.

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:

				WALTER
		But that is up to little Larry here.  
		Isn't it, Larry?

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out 
the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out 
at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

Larry does not respond.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Look, man, did you--

				WALTER
		Dude, please!. . .  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Just ask him if he--ask him about 
		the car, man!

Walter is still holding out the homework.

				WALTER
		Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Is the car out front yours?

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		We know it's his fucking homework, 
		Walter!  Where's the fucking money, 
		you little brat?

Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework 
extended towards him.

				WALTER
		Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard 
		of Vietnam?

				DUDE
		Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

				WALTER
		You're going to enter a world of 
		pain, son.  We know that this is 
		your homework.  We know you stole a 
		car--

				DUDE
		And the fucking money!

				WALTER
		And the fucking money.  And we know 
		that this is your homework, Larry.

No answer.

				WALTER
		You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

FINALLY, IN DISGUST:

				WALTER
		Ah, this is pointless.

As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

				WALTER
		All right, Plan B.  You might want 
		to watch out the front window there, 
		Larry.

He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to 
follow him.

				WALTER
		This is what happens when you FUCK a 
		STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

OUTSIDE

Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like 
an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, 
the Dude, who follows:

				WALTER
		Fucking language problem, Dude.

He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes 
out a tire iron.

				WALTER
		Maybe he'll understand this.

He is walking over to the Corvette.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which 
shatters.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.

				WALTER
		THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A 
		STRANGER IN THE ASS!

Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs 
bark.

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER 
		IN THE ASS!

CRASH!

A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over 
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of 
the crowbar.

				MAN
		WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!

He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

				MAN
		I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!

Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

				WALTER
		Hunh?

The man looks about, wildly.

				MAN
		I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR 
		FUCKEEN CAR!

He runs over to the Dude's car.

				DUDE
		No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

CRASH!  CRASH!

				MAN
		I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

CRASH!

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

INSIDE THE CAR

Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

					  ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

THE DUDE'S CAR

We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as 
it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows.

The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 
'on In-and-Out Burgers.

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four 
into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

				DUDE
		I accept your apology. . . No I, I 
		just want to handle it myself from 
		now on. . . No.  That has nothing to 
		do with it. . . .Yes, it made it 
		home, I'm calling from home.  No, 
		Walter, it didn't look like Larry 
		was about to crack.

He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair 
that stands nearby.

				DUDE
		Well that's your perception. . . 
		Well you're right, Walter, and the 
		unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND 
		LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, 
		I'll be at practice.

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into 
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced 
against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when 
the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the 
floor.

				DUDE
		Huh?

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, 
kicking the chair away.

				WOO
		Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
		Treehorn wants to see you.

				BLOND MAN
		And we know which Lebowski you are, 
		Lebowski.

				WOO
		Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk 
		to the deadbeat Lebowski.

				BLOND MAN
		You're not dealing with morons here.

BLACKNESS

Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is 
a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her 
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a 
beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

MALIBU BEACH

A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried 
hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual 
attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in 
nightmarish slow motion.

WIDER

It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing 
kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.

In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  
into darkness, descends into light, rises again.

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach 
light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants 
and a Turnbull &amp; Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the 
neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and 
disappears.

				MAN
		Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm 
		Jackie Treehorn.

INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE

The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.

				DUDE
		This is quite a pad you got here, 
		man.  Completely unspoiled.

				TREEHORN
		What's your drink, Dude?

				DUDE
		White Russian, thanks.  How's the 
		smut business, Jackie?

				TREEHORN
		I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in 
		publishing, entertainment, political 
		advocacy, and--

				DUDE
		Which one was Logjammin'?

				TREEHORN
		Regrettably, it's true, standards 
		have fallen in adult entertainment.  
		It's video, Dude.  Now that we're 
		competing with the amateurs, we can't 
		afford to invest that little extra 
		in story, production value, feeling.

He taps his forehead with one finger.

				TREEHORN
		People forget that the brain is the 
		biggest erogenous zone--

				DUDE
		On you, maybe.

He hands him the drink.

				TREEHORN
		Of course, you do get the good with 
		the bad.  The new technology permits 
		us to do exciting things with 
		interactive erotic software.  Wave 
		of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off 
		manually.

				TREEHORN
		Of course you do.  I can see you're 
		anxious for me to get to the point.  
		Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

				DUDE
		I thought you might know, man.

				TREEHORN
		Me?  How would I know?  The only 
		reason she ran off was to get away 
		from her rather sizable debt to me.

				DUDE
		But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Treehorn waves this off.

				TREEHORN
		I've heard the kidnapping story, so 
		save it.  I know you're mixed up in 
		all this, Dude, and I don't care 
		what you're trying to take off her 
		husband.  That's your business.  All 
		I'm saying is, I want mine.

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, right man, there are 
		many facets to this, uh, you know, 
		many interested parties.  If I can 
		find your money, man-- what's in it 
		for the Dude?

				TREEHORN
		Of course, there's that to discuss.  
		Refill?

				DUDE
		Does the Pope shit in the woods?

				TREEHORN
		Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

				DUDE
		Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way 
		you do business.  Your money is being 
		held by a kid named Larry Sellers.  
		He lives in North Hollywood, on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.  
		A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure 
		your goons'll be able to get it off 
		him, mean he's only fifteen and he's 
		flunking social studies.  So if you'll 
		just write me a check for my ten per 
		cent. . . of half a million. . . 
		fifty grand.

He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.

				DUDE
		I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you 
		mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.

				TREEHORN
		A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your 
		idea of a joke?

Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on 
either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking 
grimly down at the Dude.

				DUDE
		No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's 
		got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just 
		wanted a car.  All the Dude ever 
		wanted. . . was his rug back. . . 
		not greedy. . . it really.

He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  
Tied the room together.

He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.

FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE

Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and 
squishes.

FAST FADE OUT

BLACK

				THE STRANGER'S VOICE
		Darkness warshed over the Dude--
		darker'n a black steer's tookus on a 
		moonless prairie night.  There was 
		no bottom.

We hear a thundering bass.

SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

ANOTHER TITLE CARD:

THE DUDE

AND

MAUDE LEBOWSKI

IN

THIRD TITLE CARD:

GUTTERBALLS

The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked 
by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  
into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  
""Just Dropped In.""

The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable 
repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light 
as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing 
operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an 
armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, 
and holds a trident.

The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps 
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- 
skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs 
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the 
end.

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their 
legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, 
the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face 
down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little 
ball-guide arrows zipping by.

The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so 
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing 
chorines.

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so 
that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward 
and his forward momentum blows back his hair.

Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, 
are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  
and rush on into black.

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless 
woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three 
men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool 
of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding 
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the 
advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of 
car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with 
flashing gumballs pulls up.

SQUAD CAR

The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the 
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

				DUDE
		He was innocent.  Not a charge was 
		true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

CHIEF'S OFFICE

The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces 
off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.

His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through 
it with disgusted incredulity.

				CHIEF
		This is your only I.D.?

He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
				DUDE
		I know my rights.

				CHIEF
		You don't know shit, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I 
		want Bill Kunstler.

				CHIEF
		What are you, some kind of sad-assed 
		refugee from the fucking sixties?

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to 
		eject you from his garden party, 
		that you were drunk and abusive.

				DUDE
		That guy treats women like objects, 
		man.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in 
		this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw 
		shit.  We got a nice quiet beach 
		community here, and I aim to keep it 
		nice and quiet.  So let me make 
		something plain.  I don't like you 
		sucking around bothering our citizens, 
		Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
		off name, I don't like your jerk-off 
		face, I don't like your jerk- off 
		behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
		off --do I make myself clear?

The Dude stares.

				DUDE
		I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It 
hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee 
splashing everywhere.

The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

				DUDE
		--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

The Chief slaps him twice.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts 
kicking at him.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep 
		your ugly fucking goldbricking ass 
		out of my beach community!

CAB

The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks 
with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his 
face and scalp.

""Peaceful Easy Feeling"" is on the radio.

DUDE'S POV

The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds 
under a knit cap.

				DUDE
		Jesus, man, can you change the 
		station?

				DRIVER
		Fuck you man!  You don't like my 
		fucking music, get your own fucking 
		cab!

				DUDE
		I've had a--

				DRIVER
		I pull over and kick your ass out, 
		man!

				DUDE
		--had a rough night, and I hate the 
		fucking Eagles, man--

				DRIVER
		That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

THE STREET

The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, 
oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.

INSIDE THE OTHER CAR

It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and 
badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a 
dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a 
kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

THE FOOTWELL

On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright 
red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.

Five more toes.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed 
to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.

				DUDE
		Jesus.

The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, 
upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

Quiet.

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.

The Dude cringes.

Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Maude?

She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.

				MAUDE
		Love me.

The Dude is stupefied.

				DUDE
		That's my robe.

					 THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:

BLACK

After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the 
blackness:

				MAUDE
		Tell me a little about yourself, 
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting 
himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness 
except for the glowing tip of the joint.

				DUDE
		I was, uh, one of the authors of the 
		Port Huron Statement.--The original 
		Port Huron Statement.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Not the compromised second draft.  
		And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the 
		Seattle Seven?

				MAUDE
		Mmnun.

Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie 
next to each other in bed.

				DUDE
		And then. . . let's see, I uh--music 
		business briefly.

				MAUDE
		Oh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed 
		of Sound Tour.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Bunch of assholes.  And then, you 
		know, little of this, little of that. 
		My career's, uh, slowed down a bit 
		lately.

				MAUDE
		What do you do for fun?

				DUDE
		Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.  
		Drive around.  The occasional acid 
		flashback.

He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a 
pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each 
kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep 
her pelvis raised.

				MAUDE
		What happened to your house?

				DUDE
		Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.  
		Wanted to save the finder's fee.

				MAUDE
		Finder's fee?

				DUDE
		He thought I had your father's money, 
		so he got me out of the way while he 
		looked for it.

				MAUDE
		It's not my father's money, it's the 
		Foundation's.  Why did he think you 
		had it?  And who does?

				DUDE
		Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.  
		Real fucking brat.

He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey--

				DUDE
		It's a complicated case, Maude.  
		Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately 
		I've been adhering to a pretty strict, 
		uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, 
		you know, limber.  I'm real fucking 
		close to your father's money, real 
		fucking close.  It's just--

				MAUDE
		I keep telling you, it's the 
		Foundation's money.  Father doesn't 
		have any.

				DUDE
		Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

				MAUDE
		No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

				DUDE
		But your father--he runs stuff, he--

				MAUDE
		We did let Father run one of the 
		companies, briefly, but he didn't do 
		very well at it.

				DUDE
		But he's--

				MAUDE
		He helps administer the charities 
		now, and I give him a reasonable 
		allowance.  He has no money of his 
		own.  I know how he likes to present 
		himself; Father's weakness is vanity.  
		Hence the slut.

				DUDE
		Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is 
		that yoga?

Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees 
pulled in.

				MAUDE
		It increases the chances of 
		conception.

The Dude spits some White Russian.

				DUDE
		Increases?

				MAUDE
		Well yes, what did you think this 
		was all about?  Fun and games?

				DUDE
		Well...no, of course not--

				MAUDE
		I want a child.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.  
		In fact I don't want the father to 
		be someone I have to see socially, 
		or who'll have any interest in rearing 
		the child himself.

				DUDE
		Huh...

Something occurs to him.

				DUDE
		So...that doctor.

				MAUDE
		Exactly.  What happened to your face?  
		Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is 
absent.

				DUDE
		No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.  
		A real reactionary. . . So your 
		father. . . Oh man, I get it!

				MAUDE
		What?

The Dude is leaving the bedroom.

				DUDE
		Yeah, my thinking about the case, 
		man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.  
		Your father--

LIVING ROOM

The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

				PHONE VOICE
		This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; 
		leave a message after the beep.

FROM THE BEDROOM:

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		What're you talking about?

Beep.

				DUDE
		Walter, if you're there, pick up the 
		fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, 
		this is an emergency.  I'm not--

				WALTER
		Dude?

				DUDE
		Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I 
		need you to come pick me up--

				WALTER
		I can't drive, Dude, it's erev 
		shabbas.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm 
		not even supposed to pick up the 
		phone, unless it's an emergency.

				DUDE
		It is a fucking emergency.

				WALTER
		I understand.  That's why I picked 
		up the phone.

				DUDE
		THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, 
		just call Donny then, and ask him to--

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

				DUDE
		WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA 
		GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR 
		I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		Jeffrey?

THE DUDE

He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His 
attention is caught by something down the street.

HIS POV

A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the 
shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.

THE DUDE

Striding purposefully down the street.

HIS POV

The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's 
ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More 
whines and coughs; no start.

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a 
newspaper, which he holds before his face.

THE DUDE

As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's 
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  
He is revved with nervous energy.

				DUDE
		Get out of that fucking car, man!

The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's 
movement as he gets out.

The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a 
short fringe and a mustache.

The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, 
		man!

				MAN
		Relax, man!  No physical harm 
		intended!

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you?  Why've you 
		been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

				MAN
		Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

The Dude is stunned.

				DUDE
		Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

				MAN
		Irish m--What the fuck are you talking 
		about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a 
		private snoop!  Like you, man!

				DUDE
		Huh?

				DA FINO
		A dick, man!  And let me tell you 
		something: I dig your work. Playing 
		one side against the other--in bed 
		with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

				DUDE
		I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay 
		away from my fucking lady friend, 
		man.

				DA FINO
		Hey hey, I'm not messing with your 
		special lady--

				DUDE
		She's not my special lady, she's my 
		fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping 
		her conceive, man!

				DA FINO
		Hey, man, I'm not--

				DUDE
		Who're you working for?  Lebowski?  
		Jackie Treehorn?

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.

				DUDE
		The?  Who the fff--

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.  It's a wandering 
		daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.  
		Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.  
		Her parents want her back.

He is fumbling in his wallet.

				DA FINO
		See?

The Dude looks at the picture.

It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but 
fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and 
straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

				DUDE
		Jesus fucking Christ.

				DA FINO
		Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

He is holding out another picture.

The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.  
The family farm.

A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat 
snow-swept landscape.

Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her 
homesick.

				DUDE
		Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on 
		the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

He hands back the picture.

She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's 
definitely not around.

				DA FINO
		Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

				DUDE
		Yeah, it sucks.

				DA FINO
		Well maybe you and me could pool our 
		resources--trade information--
		professional courtesy--compeers, you 
		know--

We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an 
approaching car.

				DUDE
		Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.  
		And stay away from my special la--
		from my fucking lady friend.

The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its 
passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and 
yapping.

DENNY'S

Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in 
black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde 
hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless 
tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, 
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and 
arms.

Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-
swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of 
the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   
They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad 
and pen.

				WAITRESS
		You folks ready?

The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.

				DIETER
		I haff lingenberry pancakes.

				KIEFFER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

				FRANZ
		Sree picks in blanket.

The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.

				DIETER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

WALTER'S CAR

Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the 
Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from 
the back seat.

				DUDE
		I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  
		We fucked up his pay-off.  And got 
		the kidnappers all pissed off, and 
		the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, 
		but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

				WALTER
		Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, 
		uh.

				DUDE
		I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
		up, then why does he still leave me 
		in charge of getting back his wife?  
		Because he fucking doesn't want her 
		back, man!  He's had enough!  He no 
		longer digs her!  It's all a show!  
		But then, why didn't he give a shit 
		about his million bucks?  I mean, he 
		knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, 
		but he never asked for it back.

				WALTER
		What's your point, Dude?

				DUDE
		His million bucks was never in it, 
		man!  There was no money in that 
		briefcase!  He was hoping they'd 
		kill her!  You throw out a ringer 
		for a ringer!

				WALTER
		Yeah?

				DUDE
		Shit yeah!

				WALTER
		Okay, but how does all this add up 
		to an emergency?

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		I'm saying, I see what you're getting 
		at, Dude, he kept the money, but my 
		point is, here we are, it's shabbas, 
		the sabbath, which I'm allowed to 
		break only if it's a matter of life 
		and death--

				DUDE
		Walter, come off it.  You're not 
		even fucking Jewish, you're--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?

				DUDE
		You're fucking Polish Catholic--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?  
		I converted when I married Cynthia!  
		Come on, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, and you were--

				WALTER
		You know this!

				DUDE
		And you were divorced five fucking 
		years ago.

				WALTER
		Yeah?  What do you think happens 
		when you get divorced?  You turn in 
		your library card?  Get a new driver's 
		license?  Stop being Jewish?

				DUDE
		This driveway.

AS HE TURNS:

				WALTER
		I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

				DUDE
		It's just part of your whole sick 
		Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her 
		fucking dog.  Going to her fucking 
		synagogue.  You're living in the 
		fucking past.

				WALTER
		Three thousand years of beautiful 
		tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
		YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE 
		PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell 
		happened?

He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where 
Walter is looking.

THE LEBOWSKI MANSION

Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he 
and the Dude get out.

Both are gaping off at the front lawn.

				WALTER
		Jesus Christ.

THEIR POV

Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a 
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a 
palm trunk.

TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY

Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, 
naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing 
into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters 
in from a boom box by the pool.

Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and 
straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the 
length of the hall.

				BRANDT
		He can't see you, Dude.

We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to 
the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its 
tail.

				DUDE
		Where'd she been?

				BRANDT
		Visiting friends of hers in Palm 
		Springs.  Just picked up and left, 
		never bothered to tell us.

				DUDE
		But I guess she told Dieter.

				WALTER
		Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped 
		her.

				BRANDT
		Who's this gentleman, Dude?

				WALTER
		Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

				BRANDT
		You shouldn't go in there, Dude!  
		He's very angry!

BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

THE GREAT ROOM

The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His 
wheelchair hums as he spins it around.

				LEBOWSKI
			(bitterly)
		Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

				DUDE
		Where's the money, Lebowski?

				WALTER
		A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY 
		LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE 
		SCUM, MAN!

The dog yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Who the hell is he?

				WALTER
		I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy 
		who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY 
		GOLDBRICKING ASS!

				DUDE
		We know the briefcase was empty, 
		man.  We know you kept the million  
		bucks yourself.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well, you have your story, I have 
		mine.  I say I entrusted the money 
		to you, and you stole it.

				WALTER
		AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING 
		YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

				DUDE
		You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped 
		and you could use it as a pretext to 
		make some money disappear.  All you 
		needed was a sap to pin it on, and 
		you'd just met me.  You thought, 
		hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone 
		the square community won't give a 
		shit about.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well?  Aren't you?

				DUDE
		Well. . . yeah.

				LEBOWSKI
		All right, get out.  Both of you.

				WALTER
		Look at that fucking phony, Dude!  
		Pretending to be a fucking 
		millionaire!

				LEBOWSKI
		I said out.  Now.

				WALTER
		Let me tell you something else.  
		I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, 
		and this guy is a fake.  A fucking 
		goldbricker.

He is crossing to Lebowski.

				WALTER
		This guy fucking walks.  I've never 
		been more certain of anything in my 
		life!

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me, mister!

Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski 
out of the wheelchair by his armpits.

				WALTER
		Walk, you fucking phony!

The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing 
the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps 
and yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Put me down, you son of a bitch!

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		It's all over, man!  We call your 
		fucking bluff!

				DUDE
		WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S 
		CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!

				WALTER
		Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!
		ACHTUNG, BABY!!

He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the 
floor, weeping.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				LEBOWSKI
			(sobbing)
		You're bullies!  Cowards, both of 
		you!

Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the 
floor.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				DUDE
		He can't walk, Walter!

				WALTER
		Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		You monsters!

				DUDE
		Help me put him back in his chair.

Walter moves to comply.

				WALTER
		Shit, sorry man.

THROUGH HIS TEARS:

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me!  You bullies!  
		You and these women!  You won't leave 
		a man his fucking balls!

				DUDE
		Walter, you fuck!

				WALTER
		Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I 
		wouldn't've done it if I knew he was 
		a fucking crybaby.

				DUDE
		We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer 
and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and 
batting the dog away.

				DUDE
		There ya go.  Sorry man.

Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

TEN PINS

Scattered at the cut.

DUDE AND WALTER

Each with a beer at the scoring table.

				WALTER
		Sure you'll see some tank battles.  
		But fighting in desert is very 
		different from fighting in canopy 
		jungle.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war 
		whereas, uh, this thing should be a 
		fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an 
		M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking 
		tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, 
		eyeball to eyeball.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		That's fuckin' combat.  The man in 
		the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy 
		fuckin' adversary.

				DONNY
		Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch 
		of fig-eaters with towels on their 
		heads tryin' to find reverse on a 
		Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

				VOICE
		HEY!

The Dude and Walter look.

Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is 
restrained by O'Brien.

				QUINTANA
		What's this ""day of rest"" shit, man?!

Walter looks at him innocently.

				QUINTANA
		What is this bullshit, man?  I don't 
		fucking care!  It don't matter to 
		Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!  
		You might fool the fucks in the league 
		office, but you don't fool Jesus!  
		It's bush league psych-out stuff!  
		Laughable, man!  I would've fucked 
		you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck 
		you in the ass next Wednesday instead!

				QUINTANA

He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him 
away.

				QUINTANA
		You got a date Wednesday, man!

Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his 
shades, watch him go.

				WALTER
		He's cracking.

BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT

Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding 
his leatherette ball satchel.

				WALTER
		A tree of life, Dude.  To all who 
		cling to it.

They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming 
from a boom box.

REVERSE

Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in 
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them 
orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been 
put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's 
creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, 
parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning 
car.

				DUDE
		They finally did it.  They killed my 
		fucking car.

				DIETER
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

				FRANZ
		Ja, it seems you forgot our little 
		deal, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		You don't have the fucking girl, 
		dipshits.  We know you never did.  
		So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

				DUDE

The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in 
German.  Under his breath:

				DONNY
		Are these the Nazis, Walter?

Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three 
men:

				WALTER
		They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to 
		be afraid of.

The Germans stop conferring.

				DIETER
		Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat 
		money or vee fuck you up.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee 
		sreaten you.

He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the 
firelight.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.

Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

				WALTER
		There's no ransom if you don't have 
		a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom 
		is.  Those are the fucking rules.

				DIETER
		Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

				WALTER
		NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
		OF- BITCHES--

				KIEFFER
		His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She 
		sought we'd be getting million 
		dollars!  Iss not fair!

				WALTER
		Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST 
		HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF 
		FUCKING CRYBABIES?!

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, 
		there never was any money.  The big 
		Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, 
		man, so take it up with him.

				WALTER
		AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

The Germans confer again, in German.

Donny is visibly frightened.

				DONNY
		Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:

				WALTER
		They won't hurt us, Donny.  These 
		men are cowards.

THE CONFERENCE ENDS:

				DIETER
		Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on 
		you und vee call it eefen.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.

The Dude is digging into his pocket.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter, we're ending this 
		thing cheap.

Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.

				WALTER
		What's mine is mine.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter!.

Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:

				DUDE
		Four dollars here!

He inspects the change in his palm.

				DUDE
		Almost five!

				DONNY
			(tremulously)
		I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

				WALTER
			(grimly)
		What's mine is mine.

With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR 
		MONEY!

				WALTER
			(coolly)
		Come and get it.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!

				WALTER
		Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

				WALTER
		Show me what you got.  Nihilist.  
		Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

In a rage, Dieter charges.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

WALTER

hurls his leather satchel.

KIEFFER

Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling 
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.

He falls back, his uzi clattering away.

WALTER

twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in 
both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes 
on Dieter's ear.

DUDE

He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate 
kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives 
a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his 
arms up, evading the kicks.

WALTER

His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his 
saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.

Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter 
screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws 
clamped.

THE SABER

Dieter drops it.

DUDE

Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.

WALTER

still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and 
Dieter's separate.

DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I 
		BELIEF IN NUSSING!

Walter spits his ear into his face.

DUDE

The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to 
establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.

				FRANZ
		VEAKLING!

WALTER

draws back his fist.

				DIETER
		NUSSING!

				WALTER
		ANTI-SEMITE!

Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter 
for the count.

DUDE AND FRANZ

With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to 
charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.

As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  
frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music 
screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is 
quiet.

All quiet.

Walter, panting, looks around.

				WALTER
		We've got a man down, Dude.

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to 
Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.

The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.

				DUDE
		Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

				WALTER
		No Dude.

				DUDE
		They shot Donny!

Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to 
Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.

				WALTER
		There weren't any shots.

				DUDE
		Then what's...

				WALTER
		It's a heart attack.

				DUDE
		Wha.

				WALTER
		Call the medics, Dude.

				DUDE
		Wha. . . Donny--

				WALTER
		Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping 
		blood.  Might pass out.

The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand 
on Donny's shoulder.

				WALTER
		Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing 
		fine.  We got help choppering in.

FADE OUT

HOLD IN BLACK

THE DUDE AND WALTER

---

They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript 
waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off 
those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He 
eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's 
army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.

				MAN
		Hello, gentlemen.  You are the 
		bereaved?

				DUDE
		Yeah man.

				MAN
		Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet 
		you.

				DUDE
		Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Walter Sobchak.

				DUDE
		The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

				DONNELLY
		Excuse me?

				DUDE
		Nothing.

				DONNELLY
		Yes.  I understand you're taking 
		away the remains.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

				DONNELLY
		We have the urn.

He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters 
to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.

				DONNELLY
		And I assume this is credit card?

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk 
to whomever wants to take it.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit 
halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head 
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a 
mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards 
Donnelly, pointing.

				WALTER
		What's this?

				DONNELLY
		That is for the urn.

				WALTER
		Don't need it.  We're scattering the 
		ashes.

				DONNELLY
		Yes, so we were informed.  However, 
		we must of course transmit the remains 
		to you in a receptacle.

				WALTER
		This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

				DONNELLY
		Yes sir.  It is our most modestly 
		priced receptacle.

				DUDE
		Well can we--

				WALTER
		A hundred and eighty dollars?!

				DONNELLY
		They range up to three thousand.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but we're--

				DUDE
		Can we just rent it from you?

				DONNELLY
		Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental 
		house.

				WALTER
		We're scattering the fucking ashes!

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T 
		MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

				DONNELLY
		Sir, please lower your voice--

				DUDE
		Hey man, don't you have something 
		else you could put it in?

				DONNELLY
		That is our most modestly priced 
		receptacle.

				WALTER
		GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND 
		HERE?!

POINT DUME -- DAY

It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk 
towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is 
one lonely car, Walter's.

Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic 
lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly 
for a beat.  Finally:

				WALTER
		I'll say a few words.

The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears 
his throat.

				WALTER
		Donny was a good bowler, and a good 
		man.  He was. . . He was one of us.  
		He was a man who loved the outdoors, 
		and bowling, and as a surfer explored 
		the beaches of southern California 
		from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he 
		was an avid bowler.  And a good 
		friend.  He died--he died as so many 
		of his generation, before his time.  
		In your wisdom you took him, Lord.  
		As you took so many bright flowering 
		young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc 
		and Hill 364.  These young men gave 
		their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny 
		who. . . who loved bowling.

Walter clears his throat.

				WALTER
		And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, 
		in accordance with what we think   
		your dying wishes might well have 
		been, we commit your mortal remains 
		to the bosom of.

Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.

				WALTER
		the Pacific Ocean, which you loved 
		so well.

AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:

				WALTER
		Goodnight, sweet prince.

The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing 
just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, 
frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.

				WALTER
		Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.

				WALTER
		Goddamn wind.

Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping 
Walter's hands away.

				DUDE
		Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking 
		asshole!

				WALTER
		Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

The Dude is near tears.

				DUDE
		You make everything a fucking 
		travesty!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

				DUDE
		What about that shit about Vietnam!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		What the fuck does Vietnam have to 
		do with anything!  What the fuck 
		were you talking about?!

Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost 
lost.

				WALTER
		Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		You're a fuck, Walter!

He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then 
wraps his arms around the Dude.

				WALTER
		Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING

We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow 
through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  
They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his 
bowling shirt.

BAR AREA

The Dude walks up to the bar.

				DUDE
		Two oat sodas, Gary.

				GARY
		Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

				DUDE
		Thanks, man.

				GARY
		Sorry to hear about Donny.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you 
		eat the bear, and, uh.

""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" has come up on the jukebox, and The 
Stranger ambles up to the bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Howdy do, Dude.

				DUDE
		Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered 
		if I'd see you again.

				THE STRANGER
		Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things 
		been goin'?

				DUDE
		Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, 
		ups and downs.

The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure, I gotcha.

The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

				DUDE
		Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I 
		gotta get back.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know 
		that you will.

THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:

				DUDE
		Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude 
		abides.

Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

				THE STRANGER
		The Dude abides.

He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into 
the camera.

				THE STRANGER
		I don't know about you, but I take 
		comfort in that.  It's good knowin' 
		he's out there, the Dude, takin' her 
		easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I 
		sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, 
		that about does her, wraps her all 
		up.  Things seem to've worked out 
		pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, 
		and it was a purt good story, dontcha 
		think?   Made me laugh to beat the 
		band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I 
		didn't like seein' Donny go. But 
		then, happen to know that there's a 
		little Lebowski on the way.  I guess 
		that's the way the whole durned human 
		comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, 
		down through the generations, westward 
		the wagons, across the sands a time 
		until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' 
		again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed 
		yourselves.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull 
back.

				THE STRANGER
		Catch ya further on down the trail.

As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his 
voice fades:

				THE STRANGER
		...Say friend, ya got any more a 
		that good sarsaparilla?...
